00:00:52.935 --> 00:00:53.965
(Staff ensured child actors' safety in the filming of this drama.)

00:00:54.535 --> 00:00:57.064
Guys, let's play together!

00:00:57.065 --> 00:00:58.473
- Hello. - Hello.

00:00:58.474 --> 00:01:02.345
(June 6, 1995, before Eun Gyeol's time traveling)

00:01:02.505 --> 00:01:04.373
This year was the 50th anniversary of our independence,

00:01:04.374 --> 00:01:06.914
and today was the 40th Memorial Day.

00:01:07.575 --> 00:01:10.984
Goodness. You guys look like aged cucumbers soaked in alcohol.

00:01:11.484 --> 00:01:12.914
Yes, it's dried pollack soup.

00:01:13.114 --> 00:01:15.025
- You're so considerate! - Here you go.

00:01:15.084 --> 00:01:17.354
You ought to spend your days off sober from time to time.

00:01:17.355 --> 00:01:20.694
Whenever you guys have days off, all you do is drink until you drop.

00:01:21.425 --> 00:01:22.863
Your parents must be working hard...

00:01:22.864 --> 00:01:25.065
in your hometowns to pay for your education here.

00:01:25.395 --> 00:01:27.493
Grandma! Can I have some food too?

00:01:27.494 --> 00:01:29.604
What have you been doing that you skipped a meal?

00:01:29.804 --> 00:01:31.104
Are you hungover too?

00:01:31.905 --> 00:01:33.875
I didn't eat at home, so I could have some of your food.

00:01:35.604 --> 00:01:37.744
- Where's Yi Chan? - I have no idea.

00:01:38.114 --> 00:01:40.644
He's been cooped up in his room with his guitar since yesterday.

00:01:40.645 --> 00:01:43.045
He's been lounging around like some lazy kid.

00:01:43.414 --> 00:01:44.514
Hey, Yi Chan!

00:01:44.515 --> 00:01:47.455
Don't make me set the table twice. Come out and eat your meal.

00:01:56.864 --> 00:01:57.864
What are you doing?

00:01:57.865 --> 00:01:58.935
Are you recording the message for your pager?

00:01:59.834 --> 00:02:00.834
Hey.

00:02:01.334 --> 00:02:03.464
Did you look into what I asked? What did you find out?

00:02:03.634 --> 00:02:05.935
Was he really a genius guitarist who used to rule his era?

00:02:06.574 --> 00:02:09.304
Yes. Hyun Yul wasn't lying.

00:02:09.645 --> 00:02:11.314
Anyone who knew how to play the guitar...

00:02:11.315 --> 00:02:12.845
tried to mimic him at least once back in the day.

00:02:13.845 --> 00:02:15.384
- Let's go. - Go where?

00:02:15.485 --> 00:02:17.515
- To see him. - Why?

00:02:19.214 --> 00:02:20.354
So he can listen to my song.

00:02:20.685 --> 00:02:22.585
Why do you want to do that all of a sudden?

00:02:22.655 --> 00:02:24.654
To participate in the National Teen Band Contest,

00:02:24.655 --> 00:02:25.994
we need to have our own song.

00:02:25.995 --> 00:02:27.394
Hey, have you gone mad?

00:02:27.894 --> 00:02:29.364
On the day of the rehearsal for the festival,

00:02:29.365 --> 00:02:31.334
we got into a fight with the Jindo Dog Gang.

00:02:31.335 --> 00:02:33.164
We almost got suspended. Have you forgotten that already?

00:02:33.894 --> 00:02:35.034
How could I forget that?

00:02:35.035 --> 00:02:36.305
But you want to do what?

00:02:36.505 --> 00:02:39.035
What? You want to participate in what contest?

00:02:39.405 --> 00:02:42.103
Your grandmother had to kneel before the dean that day.

00:02:42.104 --> 00:02:44.004
The bruises on her knees are still there, you punk.

00:02:44.005 --> 00:02:45.845
That's why I must restore my honor!

00:02:46.275 --> 00:02:47.814
If I give up on my band now,

00:02:47.815 --> 00:02:50.383
I'll be nothing but a reckless guy who made a band to hit on a girl...

00:02:50.384 --> 00:02:52.115
and started a group fight.

00:02:53.014 --> 00:02:56.025
Yi Chan. Please give up already.

00:02:56.424 --> 00:02:59.025
Our band disbanded. Don't you remember?

00:02:59.224 --> 00:03:02.323
All right. We will begin the rehearsal...

00:03:02.324 --> 00:03:04.323
for First Love Memory Manipulators.

00:03:04.324 --> 00:03:05.464
(Yoon Dong Jin, the original member of First Love Memory Manipulators)

00:03:05.465 --> 00:03:08.703
One, two, three...

00:03:08.704 --> 00:03:09.734
Let's go!

00:03:12.335 --> 00:03:14.035
- Hey, let's go. - Get them.

00:03:15.544 --> 00:03:16.544
You jerk!

00:03:17.574 --> 00:03:19.074
Hey. Crush him!

00:03:27.055 --> 00:03:28.085
Darn it.

00:03:49.805 --> 00:03:51.614
Hyun Yul was crushed by the stage equipment.

00:03:51.615 --> 00:03:52.644
He'll be hospitalized for 12 weeks.

00:03:53.044 --> 00:03:54.275
It was awful meeting you guys.

00:03:54.644 --> 00:03:55.845
I hope I never see you again.

00:03:57.544 --> 00:03:59.215
Dong Jin got annoyed and left the band.

00:04:00.315 --> 00:04:01.584
- In His name... - Si Guk was sent...

00:04:01.585 --> 00:04:03.884
to a prayer retreat, and the bruise on his back is never going away.

00:04:08.394 --> 00:04:10.065
Se Bum was forced to study abroad.

00:04:10.894 --> 00:04:13.234
We don't have any other members left for the band.

00:04:13.965 --> 00:04:16.865
Exactly. I must meet with him and ask for help.

00:04:17.405 --> 00:04:19.203
I can seek musical advice from him too.

00:04:19.204 --> 00:04:20.774
I'll ask him to recommend me some people too.

00:04:20.775 --> 00:04:22.405
Then we'll form our band again.

00:04:22.905 --> 00:04:25.845
Gosh. There's no talking to you. What am I going to do with you?

00:04:28.544 --> 00:04:31.684
Gosh. My father texted me 8282. That means to hurry back home.

00:04:31.685 --> 00:04:32.784
I must get going now.

00:04:33.214 --> 00:04:34.214
Hey!

00:04:35.685 --> 00:04:36.685
Sorry.

00:04:36.686 --> 00:04:39.224
I must keep a low profile because of that incident for the time being.

00:04:39.225 --> 00:04:40.694
You can go and meet him alone. I'm sorry.

00:04:41.824 --> 00:04:42.865
That jerk.

00:04:47.534 --> 00:04:48.605
Where's his loyalty?

00:04:55.774 --> 00:04:59.644
(White Night)

00:05:14.625 --> 00:05:15.625
Hello, sir.

00:05:15.626 --> 00:05:16.823
I'm in 11th grade and go to Baekwang High School.

00:05:16.824 --> 00:05:18.594
My name is Ha Yi Chan.

00:05:18.964 --> 00:05:20.193
You remember me, right?

00:05:20.194 --> 00:05:21.704
I'm Hyun Yul's friend.

00:05:22.105 --> 00:05:24.235
You bought our band meat the other day.

00:05:24.334 --> 00:05:26.004
I do remember. But what a shame.

00:05:26.005 --> 00:05:28.774
Something came up. I was on my way out.

00:05:28.944 --> 00:05:29.975
Pardon?

00:05:30.644 --> 00:05:32.315
But you made an appointment with me first.

00:05:32.415 --> 00:05:35.013
Anyway, I'm sorry. Let's do this another day.

00:05:35.014 --> 00:05:36.485
Can you spare me just 30 minutes then?

00:05:36.815 --> 00:05:38.584
It's a short song because it's unfinished.

00:05:38.884 --> 00:05:39.884
Let's do this next time.

00:05:39.885 --> 00:05:42.225
I'll make sure to put aside time to listen to this with you.

00:05:42.384 --> 00:05:43.554
Just spare me 20 minutes, sir.

00:05:43.555 --> 00:05:45.393
No, 10 minutes. Or 5 minutes.

00:05:45.394 --> 00:05:46.854
Or 3 minutes and 30 seconds. Please, sir!

00:05:46.855 --> 00:05:48.324
Please listen to my song, sir!

00:05:49.264 --> 00:05:51.634
Everyone has their own life.

00:05:51.795 --> 00:05:54.764
Isn't it bad manners to impose like this on other people?

00:05:57.634 --> 00:05:59.735
I get it. I'm sorry.

00:06:00.505 --> 00:06:01.505
Bye.

00:06:08.784 --> 00:06:10.444
Minor coincidences come together...

00:06:10.844 --> 00:06:12.685
to bring luck miraculously...

00:06:13.115 --> 00:06:15.524
or to create an unbelievable tragedy.

00:06:17.685 --> 00:06:18.894
If...

00:06:19.394 --> 00:06:22.065
he listened to Yi Chan's song just for five minutes...

00:06:24.594 --> 00:06:26.594
- Darn it. - I'm sorry.

00:06:26.865 --> 00:06:28.865
Hey, you handsome boy.

00:06:29.834 --> 00:06:31.935
Look over there.

00:06:32.574 --> 00:06:34.134
A lot of cars come and go here.

00:06:34.574 --> 00:06:37.574
It will be dangerous for you to play with this here.

00:06:38.115 --> 00:06:39.514
Where's your mother?

00:06:39.915 --> 00:06:40.944
Over there.

00:06:41.315 --> 00:06:42.713
Could I take this as a freebie?

00:06:42.714 --> 00:06:44.213
Gosh, I said no.

00:06:44.214 --> 00:06:46.184
- Come on. You can spare me this. - I'm not making any money then.

00:06:46.185 --> 00:06:47.354
- If... - Seriously.

00:06:47.355 --> 00:06:49.424
- Do you want to see something cool? - Yes!

00:06:49.425 --> 00:06:51.324
he didn't come across the boy that day...

00:06:59.165 --> 00:07:00.334
You can come out now.

00:07:03.134 --> 00:07:04.235
If...

00:07:04.774 --> 00:07:07.505
he didn't have any surprise guest visiting that day...

00:07:09.404 --> 00:07:10.943
- Do you want to take this? - Yes. Give me 20 of this.

00:07:10.944 --> 00:07:11.944
Okay.

00:07:12.144 --> 00:07:15.443
Dad. Can you give us the elastic one in the 3cm checkered pattern?

00:07:15.444 --> 00:07:16.514
If his friend...

00:07:17.185 --> 00:07:18.884
- accompanied him that day... - Do you need anything else?

00:07:19.055 --> 00:07:21.484
I'll teach you how to score a big one!

00:07:21.485 --> 00:07:24.854
- Hey. You're going to drive? - Hey.

00:07:24.855 --> 00:07:25.893
Gosh. Just go.

00:07:25.894 --> 00:07:28.224
- If it wasn't... - Hey. You're driving?

00:07:28.225 --> 00:07:29.694
- a national holiday that day... - Are you serious?

00:07:31.834 --> 00:07:32.865
Gosh.

00:07:36.565 --> 00:07:37.865
Do you want me to show you a swing this time?

00:07:40.334 --> 00:07:41.475
If...

00:07:45.344 --> 00:07:48.615
one of these minor coincidences didn't happen that day...

00:07:49.045 --> 00:07:50.713
- Hey. - Hello.

00:07:50.714 --> 00:07:52.415
Thanks. Wait.

00:07:53.384 --> 00:07:54.513
Take one with you.

00:07:54.514 --> 00:07:55.624
No. It's okay.

00:07:55.625 --> 00:07:56.883
- I appreciate the gesture, though. - I just feel bad.

00:07:56.884 --> 00:07:59.394
Actually, I'm allergic to Korean melons.

00:08:00.755 --> 00:08:02.194
If just one of them didn't happen to him...

00:08:05.634 --> 00:08:06.634
Wait!

00:08:15.574 --> 00:08:16.875
If it did,

00:08:17.774 --> 00:08:18.875
would he be...

00:08:19.915 --> 00:08:22.014
living a completely different life by now?

00:08:28.454 --> 00:08:29.584
Is this a novel?

00:08:29.654 --> 00:08:31.894
(Fall of 2022)

00:08:36.594 --> 00:08:37.594
Right.

00:08:39.235 --> 00:08:40.964
Is this a novel?

00:08:42.134 --> 00:08:43.904
Why? Is it interesting?

00:08:44.165 --> 00:08:45.305
Well...

00:08:45.904 --> 00:08:47.304
The incident isn't that dramatic.

00:08:50.975 --> 00:08:53.115
By the way, why are you suddenly writing a novel?

00:08:54.345 --> 00:08:55.544
Don't tell me...

00:08:56.115 --> 00:08:57.585
you're going to retire as a taekwondo player.

00:08:58.855 --> 00:09:01.314
No. I want to show it to my brother.

00:09:01.985 --> 00:09:02.985
Your brother?

00:09:03.355 --> 00:09:04.894
You want to show it to your brother?

00:09:05.225 --> 00:09:07.293
If you hadn't caught me with that,

00:09:07.294 --> 00:09:09.365
my brother would have been the first one to read it.

00:09:10.125 --> 00:09:11.865
When will you show it to your brother?

00:09:24.674 --> 00:09:26.144
I don't follow.

00:09:28.384 --> 00:09:29.615
Once I finish it.

00:09:30.715 --> 00:09:33.884
I see. So what happens to the main character?

00:09:34.654 --> 00:09:35.855
He becomes our dad.

00:09:38.024 --> 00:09:39.725
That's not a novel.

00:09:40.195 --> 00:09:41.325
It's a true story.

00:09:43.625 --> 00:09:45.134
I heard something from Eun Ho.

00:09:45.664 --> 00:09:47.133
The date of Yi Chan's accident...

00:09:47.134 --> 00:09:50.164
Hey, you. Look at these two teenagers!

00:09:51.034 --> 00:09:54.005
Acting lovey-dovey out in public after playing hooky.

00:09:54.205 --> 00:09:55.744
Are you coming back from school, Yi Chan?

00:09:55.745 --> 00:09:57.005
Hello.

00:09:57.105 --> 00:09:58.143
- I'm coming back from school. - It wasn't the day...

00:09:58.144 --> 00:09:59.144
before the festival.

00:09:59.215 --> 00:10:00.845
You're really handsome.

00:10:01.715 --> 00:10:03.115
- Ma'am, you're still so beautiful. - The accident...

00:10:04.684 --> 00:10:06.085
hasn't happened yet.

00:10:07.054 --> 00:10:08.684
- I'll get going now. - Okay.

00:10:09.024 --> 00:10:10.085
- Bye. - Bye.

00:10:14.965 --> 00:10:16.064
What are you guys doing?

00:10:16.965 --> 00:10:18.394
I'm talking to you!

00:10:21.235 --> 00:10:22.865
They're having fun with this, aren't they?

00:10:32.544 --> 00:10:33.644
Are you all right?

00:10:34.314 --> 00:10:35.384
Then when is it?

00:10:37.745 --> 00:10:39.154
When does the accident happen?

00:10:49.024 --> 00:10:51.865
(Selling the national flags for the Memorial Day)

00:10:59.904 --> 00:11:00.904
It's tomorrow.

00:11:05.245 --> 00:11:08.945
This is amazing. I can't believe it!

00:11:09.514 --> 00:11:13.514
You're glowing in all of these shirts.

00:11:15.225 --> 00:11:16.384
What are you two doing?

00:11:16.755 --> 00:11:17.924
Hey, you're home.

00:11:18.325 --> 00:11:20.955
I took her out and went shopping.

00:11:24.024 --> 00:11:26.835
Why did you buy so much? Who knows how long she'll stay here?

00:11:26.894 --> 00:11:28.864
You have no idea how many basic necessities...

00:11:28.865 --> 00:11:30.403
one needs to live in a new place.

00:11:30.404 --> 00:11:33.335
Even if she stays here for a day, she should be comfortable.

00:11:33.505 --> 00:11:35.244
At this rate, you might head to the borough office tomorrow...

00:11:35.245 --> 00:11:36.273
to register her under you.

00:11:36.274 --> 00:11:38.044
Gosh. This is so fun.

00:11:38.144 --> 00:11:40.174
I'm used to having only guys in my house.

00:11:40.345 --> 00:11:42.313
Now that I have a girl staying in my house,

00:11:42.314 --> 00:11:46.054
it's like I'm playing princess. This is quite fun.

00:11:47.014 --> 00:11:48.985
You've never thought about playing prince?

00:11:49.125 --> 00:11:52.524
A handsome prince has been living with you for 18 years.

00:11:53.024 --> 00:11:54.024
Hey.

00:11:54.294 --> 00:11:58.365
I'll wash this thoroughly and make a blanket for you.

00:11:58.865 --> 00:12:01.235
Cover yourself with it when you go to sleep. Okay?

00:12:04.264 --> 00:12:06.234
Gosh. This is frustrating.

00:12:06.235 --> 00:12:08.944
If only she could hear me, it would have been perfect.

00:12:08.945 --> 00:12:10.304
- Grandma! - Gosh.

00:12:11.845 --> 00:12:14.945
You almost had my heart shoot out of my throat, you brat.

00:12:15.985 --> 00:12:16.985
Wait here.

00:12:21.215 --> 00:12:22.225
Gosh.

00:12:41.534 --> 00:12:43.575
(Chung Ah, I'll make you a blanket.)

00:12:52.684 --> 00:12:54.514
(Thank you.)

00:12:59.924 --> 00:13:01.095
I made this!

00:13:06.335 --> 00:13:07.595
(Snail Guesthouse)

00:14:05.294 --> 00:14:06.355
It's a novel.

00:14:07.394 --> 00:14:08.764
My brother came up with the story.

00:14:14.064 --> 00:14:16.005
It's not a novel. He said it was a true story.

00:14:16.134 --> 00:14:17.434
He likes to joke around.

00:14:18.235 --> 00:14:20.474
You think he would use his parents' tragedy as a joke?

00:14:20.475 --> 00:14:22.375
He's always been off-the-wall.

00:14:22.904 --> 00:14:23.904
Ha Eun Gyeol.

00:14:30.784 --> 00:14:32.585
There's no way only I was in the dark about it.

00:14:33.715 --> 00:14:36.024
There's no way my dad only told him about the accident.

00:14:36.524 --> 00:14:39.524
Eun Ho didn't hear it from his dad. He found out by chance.

00:14:40.524 --> 00:14:42.225
Are you seriously using that as an excuse?

00:14:42.625 --> 00:14:44.365
A falling accident from the lift?

00:14:44.764 --> 00:14:46.594
This isn't some third-tier regional event.

00:14:46.595 --> 00:14:48.664
It's a concert that generates hundreds of thousands of dollars.

00:14:49.105 --> 00:14:51.235
I told you to be thorough with the safety gear.

00:14:52.634 --> 00:14:53.674
Hey.

00:15:03.345 --> 00:15:04.845
Ha Yi Chan?

00:15:05.314 --> 00:15:08.283
I told you to be careful with potential injuries at all times.

00:15:08.284 --> 00:15:09.355
Didn't I tell you that?

00:15:10.154 --> 00:15:12.024
I can't compete if I'm scared of getting injured.

00:15:13.054 --> 00:15:14.154
The moment I give up...

00:15:16.894 --> 00:15:19.195
The match is over.

00:15:22.965 --> 00:15:23.965
Yi Chan.

00:15:28.404 --> 00:15:29.445
Ha Yi Chan.

00:15:32.144 --> 00:15:33.144
You punk.

00:15:34.014 --> 00:15:35.314
So you're still alive.

00:15:44.924 --> 00:15:47.095
No. You know what?

00:15:47.695 --> 00:15:49.095
Let's not do this here.

00:15:49.865 --> 00:15:51.294
Let's go to a cafe nearby.

00:15:51.365 --> 00:15:53.365
- Let's... - Sir!

00:15:54.164 --> 00:15:55.505
The doctor wants to see you.

00:15:55.735 --> 00:15:56.933
- Wait here. - Why?

00:15:56.934 --> 00:15:58.773
- I'll go and see your doctor. - Is it bad?

00:15:58.774 --> 00:16:00.474
They will have to perform the surgery now.

00:16:00.475 --> 00:16:02.105
- Where is he right now? - Over there.

00:16:03.075 --> 00:16:05.514
Wait! Yi Chan.

00:16:06.115 --> 00:16:07.544
Hey, Ha Yi Chan!

00:16:21.524 --> 00:16:24.125
I'm Ha Yi Chan's son, Ha Eun Ho.

00:16:24.695 --> 00:16:27.095
Who are you?

00:16:30.634 --> 00:16:31.664
Hello.

00:16:32.705 --> 00:16:33.804
Nice to meet you.

00:16:35.235 --> 00:16:36.345
I am...

00:16:36.875 --> 00:16:38.404
your father's high school friend.

00:16:43.284 --> 00:16:45.884
I'm sorry to call you out of the blue like this.

00:16:50.225 --> 00:16:51.325
Don't be sorry.

00:16:53.125 --> 00:16:54.924
I've been waiting for you to call.

00:16:56.394 --> 00:16:58.595
You said you had questions for me.

00:16:59.294 --> 00:17:00.564
Ask them away.

00:17:07.134 --> 00:17:08.505
Was my father...

00:17:09.674 --> 00:17:10.804
able to hear...

00:17:11.674 --> 00:17:12.945
in high school?

00:17:19.814 --> 00:17:21.084
Who was his friend?

00:17:21.584 --> 00:17:22.584
I don't know.

00:17:22.955 --> 00:17:25.024
- Not even a name? - No.

00:17:25.624 --> 00:17:27.725
Back then, that wasn't important.

00:17:28.624 --> 00:17:31.394
I only heard that his friend regretted not going there...

00:17:31.395 --> 00:17:33.864
with Yi Chan that day and blamed himself for it.

00:17:39.935 --> 00:17:42.175
- Ma Joo. - Ma Joo?

00:17:43.344 --> 00:17:45.674
He would've been the only person my dad would've trusted...

00:17:45.675 --> 00:17:47.374
and discussed band matters as he was the manager.

00:17:48.274 --> 00:17:51.314
His friend who couldn't go with my dad that day must be Ma Joo.

00:17:54.915 --> 00:17:56.024
But this is odd.

00:17:57.425 --> 00:17:59.955
He said he regretted it and blamed himself for it.

00:18:00.554 --> 00:18:02.665
How come he didn't stay in touch with my dad?

00:18:03.925 --> 00:18:06.764
Yi Chan was the one who cut all ties with his friend.

00:18:08.804 --> 00:18:10.905
Eun Ho asked his dad after some time.

00:18:11.665 --> 00:18:12.734
Then he said...

00:18:12.735 --> 00:18:14.735
(Late fall of 2022)

00:18:20.874 --> 00:18:22.544
When I meet my friends from high school,

00:18:24.314 --> 00:18:25.614
my heart breaks a bit...

00:18:27.514 --> 00:18:29.584
because I miss those days.

00:18:36.624 --> 00:18:37.995
Whenever they see me,

00:18:38.225 --> 00:18:40.635
they seem sad, and watching their sad faces...

00:18:41.895 --> 00:18:43.064
is painful too.

00:18:54.114 --> 00:18:55.445
I think I can understand him.

00:18:56.385 --> 00:18:59.554
He misses them, but he doesn't have the courage to see them.

00:19:05.895 --> 00:19:08.093
He can't face them because he's afraid...

00:19:08.094 --> 00:19:10.094
that they might hurt each other.

00:19:17.564 --> 00:19:19.005
Jonathan.

00:19:20.774 --> 00:19:21.833
What did you say?

00:19:21.834 --> 00:19:23.674
Many things have changed...

00:19:23.675 --> 00:19:25.745
since I joined the band instead of Dong Jin.

00:19:26.314 --> 00:19:29.014
But I think Yi Chan would still know similar people.

00:19:30.114 --> 00:19:31.114
So?

00:19:32.284 --> 00:19:34.353
A grown-up who knows enough about bands...

00:19:34.354 --> 00:19:36.084
for my dad to ask for advice on music.

00:19:36.584 --> 00:19:38.024
A guitarist who runs a store...

00:19:38.794 --> 00:19:41.594
and knows the members of The Manipulators.

00:19:42.725 --> 00:19:45.995
I'm sure my dad was supposed to meet Jonathan that day.

00:20:41.455 --> 00:20:45.124
If it's Jonathan my dad is supposed to meet tomorrow,

00:20:46.225 --> 00:20:48.524
even if we can't locate the place where the accident will happen,

00:20:51.294 --> 00:20:52.895
we can narrow it down.

00:20:55.364 --> 00:20:56.534
Near White Night Music.

00:20:57.165 --> 00:20:58.165
Yes.

00:21:00.175 --> 00:21:02.873
Tomorrow, you must stay with Yi Chan no matter what.

00:21:02.874 --> 00:21:05.303
I'll be watching the scene of the accident...

00:21:05.304 --> 00:21:06.814
and trying my best to prevent any variables from happening.

00:21:06.975 --> 00:21:08.985
What are you talking about? Why would you go there?

00:21:09.215 --> 00:21:12.454
Well, it's to make it extra safe.

00:21:12.455 --> 00:21:13.885
Or it's like the second line of defense.

00:21:14.114 --> 00:21:15.884
If you miss Yi Chan,

00:21:15.885 --> 00:21:17.455
I can stop him there.

00:21:17.725 --> 00:21:19.793
What if you get hurt?

00:21:19.794 --> 00:21:21.194
Don't worry.

00:21:21.195 --> 00:21:23.395
I'll immediately run away when I sense danger.

00:21:23.965 --> 00:21:25.764
- Still... - Eun Gyeol.

00:21:26.495 --> 00:21:28.333
The two moons didn't rise yet.

00:21:28.334 --> 00:21:29.904
And we're still in this time period.

00:21:29.905 --> 00:21:32.374
We can stop it for sure.

00:21:33.475 --> 00:21:34.905
Trust your helper.

00:21:49.824 --> 00:21:50.854
Go in.

00:21:51.124 --> 00:21:53.124
Okay. Bye.

00:21:53.624 --> 00:21:55.324
Have sweet dreams tonight.

00:21:56.594 --> 00:21:57.624
Eun Yu.

00:21:58.324 --> 00:22:00.564
What? It's my name.

00:22:02.235 --> 00:22:05.405
Hearing my name here makes me so happy and nostalgic.

00:22:07.604 --> 00:22:08.635
Thank you.

00:22:11.905 --> 00:22:13.215
Am I going to a war or something?

00:22:13.445 --> 00:22:14.975
I'm sure you're one of the reasons...

00:22:15.985 --> 00:22:17.584
why I came to this time period.

00:22:18.685 --> 00:22:21.284
Yes. I agree, sir.

00:22:22.985 --> 00:22:24.584
Let's go back together no matter what happens.

00:22:25.955 --> 00:22:28.593
In 2023, I'll pay you back 1,000 times or 10,000 times...

00:22:28.594 --> 00:22:29.665
what you did for me.

00:22:30.124 --> 00:22:31.165
Wait.

00:22:32.195 --> 00:22:35.194
That's slightly less than enough,

00:22:35.195 --> 00:22:36.334
but I'll look forward to it.

00:22:48.374 --> 00:22:50.214
The two moons didn't rise yet.

00:22:50.215 --> 00:22:51.744
And we're still in this time period.

00:22:51.745 --> 00:22:54.314
We can stop it for sure.

00:23:01.695 --> 00:23:02.725
Eun Gyeol?

00:23:06.034 --> 00:23:07.264
We're from Mapo Police Station.

00:23:08.235 --> 00:23:09.564
Please come with us for a moment.

00:23:10.205 --> 00:23:12.435
We got a report about Chung Ah's abduction.

00:23:13.635 --> 00:23:15.135
Are you sure you can handle the consequences...

00:23:15.604 --> 00:23:17.175
and take responsibility for this?

00:23:18.505 --> 00:23:21.274
If you walk out that door now,

00:23:21.645 --> 00:23:23.584
you will regret it.

00:23:26.614 --> 00:23:29.824
Let's go. I also have something to say.

00:23:36.605 --> 00:23:38.004
(Seogyo-dong)

00:23:40.605 --> 00:23:42.474
Mapo Police Station is over there. Where are you taking me?

00:23:47.714 --> 00:23:48.744
What are you?

00:23:49.315 --> 00:23:50.815
You're not police officers, are you?

00:23:51.885 --> 00:23:54.655
I heard you were smart, but you're just a kid.

00:23:57.694 --> 00:23:58.754
(Chairwoman Im Ji Mi)

00:23:59.295 --> 00:24:01.825
When you get his written oath, send it through a fax machine.

00:24:03.264 --> 00:24:06.203
Watch him board a ship before departing.

00:24:06.204 --> 00:24:07.464
Then bring Chung Ah.

00:24:13.105 --> 00:24:14.444
I'm not sure.

00:24:16.274 --> 00:24:19.145
He chose to stow away as he didn't have a legal identity.

00:24:20.385 --> 00:24:22.044
And no one would know that he disappeared...

00:24:22.045 --> 00:24:23.754
as he doesn't have a family.

00:24:24.454 --> 00:24:25.924
Do I even have to worry about what might happen later?

00:24:49.514 --> 00:24:51.014
Aren't you just happy to see me again?

00:24:51.145 --> 00:24:52.584
There's no way that I'm happy to see a hunting dog...

00:24:52.585 --> 00:24:53.615
that has gone crazy after tasting money.

00:24:53.784 --> 00:24:55.045
Are you good at copying words?

00:24:56.055 --> 00:24:58.054
Copy them and sign it.

00:24:58.055 --> 00:24:59.184
Then I'll set you free.

00:25:00.684 --> 00:25:01.724
It's simple.

00:25:02.155 --> 00:25:04.354
"From the electric shock accident..."

00:25:04.355 --> 00:25:06.365
"to becoming a tutor, I planned everything to approach her."

00:25:06.524 --> 00:25:08.624
"I acknowledge that I kidnapped Yoon Chung Ah..."

00:25:08.625 --> 00:25:09.734
"and demanded a ransom."

00:25:10.034 --> 00:25:11.364
"I got the money I wanted,"

00:25:11.365 --> 00:25:14.504
"and I will never show up to the Jinsung Family."

00:25:16.335 --> 00:25:17.774
Do you think I'll do it?

00:25:18.174 --> 00:25:20.473
You'll get rich if you sign it obediently.

00:25:20.474 --> 00:25:22.575
If you act up, your life will end.

00:25:22.714 --> 00:25:25.345
The most luxurious ship is ready for you.

00:25:29.815 --> 00:25:32.555
Don't even dream of it. Those guys have many tattoos.

00:25:32.655 --> 00:25:34.023
They know how to use tools as well.

00:25:34.024 --> 00:25:36.924
They know how to use a shovel to dig the ground to bury someone.

00:25:38.424 --> 00:25:41.194
Why are you scared? I already gave you the right answer.

00:25:42.494 --> 00:25:43.534
Let's get it done quickly.

00:25:45.665 --> 00:25:48.534

This isn't what you promised.

00:26:16.464 --> 00:26:17.963
Where are you going right now?

00:26:17.964 --> 00:26:19.964
You said you would set me free if I signed it.

00:26:20.105 --> 00:26:22.165
Stop the car.

00:26:23.274 --> 00:26:25.674
Let me get out. Let me go.

00:26:27.944 --> 00:26:29.514
Hurry up and bring it to me.

00:26:32.784 --> 00:26:34.144
You came home.

00:26:34.145 --> 00:26:36.253
You came a day earlier than planned.

00:26:36.254 --> 00:26:38.655
Did you not hear me? Bring it to me.

00:26:42.724 --> 00:26:45.125
Did they make a mistake?

00:26:52.865 --> 00:26:54.964
Sir.

00:27:03.214 --> 00:27:06.744
Why on earth are you doing this?

00:27:07.145 --> 00:27:10.155
This is just an attic, a storage.

00:27:12.315 --> 00:27:14.224
Open it yourself.

00:27:17.595 --> 00:27:18.895
Do I have to repeat myself?

00:27:38.244 --> 00:27:39.713
I told you.

00:27:39.714 --> 00:27:41.784
It's just an attic.

00:27:42.214 --> 00:27:44.683
Chung Ah wanted to store her clothes...

00:27:44.684 --> 00:27:46.825
she doesn't wear anymore here.

00:28:24.855 --> 00:28:28.524
She's been too stubborn since she was little.

00:28:29.964 --> 00:28:31.635
When she got upset during her tutoring session,

00:28:32.194 --> 00:28:34.534
she bit me, scratched me, and broke things.

00:28:35.934 --> 00:28:37.934
Once she ran into this room and locked the door,

00:28:38.135 --> 00:28:39.444
there was nothing I could do.

00:28:40.004 --> 00:28:41.944
"Shall I break down the walls and get rid of the room?"

00:28:42.714 --> 00:28:44.474
I definitely considered it,

00:28:45.174 --> 00:28:46.844
but I thought it was a good idea...

00:28:46.845 --> 00:28:49.655
to keep a shelter that only Chung Ah could use.

00:28:49.784 --> 00:28:52.213
Do you think using English words would make this misery look better?

00:28:52.214 --> 00:28:54.555
I kept the room for Chung Ah's sake.

00:28:55.585 --> 00:28:58.994
When chased and cornered,

00:28:59.665 --> 00:29:01.564
even a rat will bite a cat.

00:29:01.565 --> 00:29:03.964
Is my daughter a rat?

00:29:08.365 --> 00:29:10.335
What have you all been doing?

00:29:11.004 --> 00:29:13.375
You turned a blind eye to it, helped her hide it, and assisted her.

00:29:14.004 --> 00:29:17.014
What did you receive in return for destroying a child's soul?

00:29:17.645 --> 00:29:21.244
We did nothing but follow Ms. Im's orders.

00:29:21.585 --> 00:29:23.855
Pack your things. You are all fired.

00:29:24.184 --> 00:29:25.184
Pardon?

00:29:25.484 --> 00:29:28.024
Ms. Im, you are fired too.

00:29:28.984 --> 00:29:32.355
Take your kids and move out of my house at once.

00:29:42.635 --> 00:29:44.974
Sir.

00:29:47.545 --> 00:29:48.845
I cannot move out.

00:29:53.385 --> 00:29:55.915
I refuse to leave this house and my school too,

00:29:56.784 --> 00:29:58.415
without a legitimate reason.

00:29:58.585 --> 00:29:59.924
"A legitimate reason?"

00:30:00.684 --> 00:30:02.183
I don't know what kinds of rumors you heard...

00:30:02.184 --> 00:30:04.595
or what you're imagining, but I...

00:30:06.865 --> 00:30:07.924
Don't tell me...

00:30:09.024 --> 00:30:10.464
it was Eun Gyeol.

00:30:11.034 --> 00:30:13.434
Finish what you were saying. I want to hear your conclusion.

00:30:18.204 --> 00:30:19.604
Do you know...

00:30:19.605 --> 00:30:21.805
what that boy did while you were away?

00:30:23.214 --> 00:30:26.484
He kidnapped Chung Ah and demanded money.

00:30:27.345 --> 00:30:28.983
Because of your reputation...

00:30:28.984 --> 00:30:31.784
and the company's public image, I couldn't even contact the police.

00:30:32.214 --> 00:30:34.125
So, I sent Attorney Jang to get things sorted out.

00:30:34.724 --> 00:30:36.625
But he ran off with the money.

00:30:37.355 --> 00:30:39.295
Are you doing this to me because you trust that boy?

00:30:59.915 --> 00:31:02.184
I should be on the stowaway boat by now, shouldn't I?

00:31:03.555 --> 00:31:05.254
You seem puzzled as to why I'm here now.

00:31:10.795 --> 00:31:12.964
Stop the car.

00:31:13.565 --> 00:31:15.764
Let me get out. Let me go.

00:31:16.024 --> 00:31:17.764
There's something I must do!

00:31:19.135 --> 00:31:20.135
Darn this kid!

00:31:25.905 --> 00:31:26.905
Hold him down!

00:31:26.905 --> 00:31:27.905
- Stop the car! - Let go!

00:31:30.244 --> 00:31:32.474
- Pull over at once. - Darn you!

00:31:40.284 --> 00:31:41.424
Hey, cops are here.

00:31:42.355 --> 00:31:43.395
- Shoot. - Darn it.

00:31:46.055 --> 00:31:47.865
Hey, run!

00:31:50.395 --> 00:31:51.434
Eun Gyeol!

00:31:53.065 --> 00:31:54.135
Mr. Shin.

00:31:54.635 --> 00:31:55.764
I'm sorry I'm late.

00:31:56.135 --> 00:31:57.635
I've been tailing you from the guesthouse,

00:31:57.974 --> 00:31:59.234
but I needed to capture some evidence.

00:32:12.754 --> 00:32:14.454
I received the fax you sent.

00:32:15.224 --> 00:32:17.555
I'm relieved that you received it before it was too late, sir.

00:32:21.825 --> 00:32:23.534
You need a legitimate reason?

00:32:25.264 --> 00:32:27.534
You took bribes using your position,

00:32:27.964 --> 00:32:29.473
engaged in an admissions bribery scheme,

00:32:29.474 --> 00:32:30.905
committed embezzlement and tax evasion,

00:32:31.335 --> 00:32:34.244
started a dummy company to make a slush fund,

00:32:34.605 --> 00:32:37.375
and kidnapped, abused, and confined a minor against her will.

00:32:39.415 --> 00:32:40.444
Do you need to hear more?

00:32:40.944 --> 00:32:42.544
Sir, that's...

00:32:42.545 --> 00:32:43.753
Once I carve you out of my family register,

00:32:43.754 --> 00:32:44.954
I'll have Mr. Shin drop off a copy.

00:32:45.355 --> 00:32:48.085
- Sir! - I told you.

00:32:49.924 --> 00:32:52.224
I said I'd teach you that good was bound to triumph over evil...

00:32:53.024 --> 00:32:54.125
and that you shouldn't...

00:32:55.464 --> 00:32:56.734
even dream of a comfortable life.

00:33:04.335 --> 00:33:05.605
Oh, my.

00:33:05.774 --> 00:33:09.474
I heard you were studying art. You really are so good at this.

00:33:11.014 --> 00:33:13.714
The boys would love this.

00:33:15.845 --> 00:33:19.115
- My, it looks so good! - Oh, my! What is this?

00:33:19.754 --> 00:33:22.994
- Hey, what is this? - It's omelet rice.

00:33:23.355 --> 00:33:24.424
Oh, my.

00:33:24.795 --> 00:33:26.694
- Thank you for the food! - Thank you for the food!

00:33:33.434 --> 00:33:36.504
Oh, right. I was supposed to go out for drinks this evening.

00:33:36.704 --> 00:33:37.734
It totally slipped my mind.

00:33:37.934 --> 00:33:41.305
Chung Ah, please save this for me.

00:33:41.405 --> 00:33:44.315
I can't eat now. I'll be eating while having drinks later.

00:33:44.645 --> 00:33:46.144
Hey, weren't we supposed to meet up with...

00:33:46.145 --> 00:33:48.885
Why didn't you remind me? Hey, wait up.

00:34:03.994 --> 00:34:06.404
What? Where did everyone go in the middle of a meal?

00:34:06.405 --> 00:34:07.464
Hello?

00:34:09.135 --> 00:34:10.174
It's me.

00:34:12.034 --> 00:34:13.045
What's up?

00:34:13.704 --> 00:34:15.673
You ignored me earlier. Why are you suddenly calling...

00:34:15.674 --> 00:34:17.075
Chairman Yoon came back to Korea.

00:34:18.274 --> 00:34:19.915
Can you bring Chung Ah here?

00:35:10.065 --> 00:35:11.134
I told you.

00:35:12.395 --> 00:35:15.304
You don't have to forgive them.

00:35:18.875 --> 00:35:21.304
You can come back and stay with us whenever you want.

00:35:23.344 --> 00:35:25.375
We'll always be on your side, no matter what.

00:35:27.014 --> 00:35:28.085
You know that, right?

00:35:31.054 --> 00:35:32.154
All right, then.

00:35:34.554 --> 00:35:36.284
Go on in. I'll get going too.

00:36:14.494 --> 00:36:15.695
Could you...

00:36:17.134 --> 00:36:18.364
spare me a moment, sir?

00:36:22.934 --> 00:36:24.534
- Why? - Don't worry.

00:36:26.134 --> 00:36:27.244
I won't cause a scene.

00:36:32.744 --> 00:36:34.585
The next time you visit, I'll be sure to serve you some tea.

00:36:34.715 --> 00:36:36.283
I just fired all my housekeepers.

00:36:36.284 --> 00:36:38.215
My grandmother doesn't know sign language at all,

00:36:42.284 --> 00:36:44.324
but I saw her chatting with Chung Ah all day.

00:36:45.895 --> 00:36:47.125
That taught me this.

00:36:48.395 --> 00:36:52.795
If you really want to express something, you will find a way.

00:36:54.735 --> 00:36:56.264
And if you want to express more,

00:37:02.545 --> 00:37:05.275
you just need to learn how to do it.

00:37:10.454 --> 00:37:12.215
(The Most Beautiful Language: Lovely Sign Language)

00:37:13.355 --> 00:37:14.525
"Your father..."

00:37:15.085 --> 00:37:17.425
"is like a shield that protects you from everything..."

00:37:18.154 --> 00:37:20.695
"until you're old enough to go out into the world."

00:37:23.335 --> 00:37:26.134
Those aren't my words. Ernest Hemingway said it.

00:37:29.775 --> 00:37:32.235
I never had such a father,

00:37:34.304 --> 00:37:35.974
but I hope Chung Ah can.

00:37:40.614 --> 00:37:43.514
You can keep that book, sir. I've already mastered it.

00:37:44.184 --> 00:37:45.215
I'll be off, then.

00:37:49.585 --> 00:37:51.625
Stendhal was the one who said it, not Hemingway.

00:37:52.925 --> 00:37:54.824
And that's what he said about his mother, not his father.

00:37:57.034 --> 00:37:59.264
- Oh. - But I got the message regardless.

00:38:01.704 --> 00:38:03.105
Thank you very much for this.

00:38:15.684 --> 00:38:16.755
Why are you following me?

00:38:17.784 --> 00:38:19.384
I want to sleep next to you today.

00:38:20.054 --> 00:38:21.654
You've been quiet for a while. What's up with you?

00:38:22.525 --> 00:38:23.554
As for Chung Ah...

00:38:25.925 --> 00:38:28.264
I believe I've finished everything I had to do.

00:38:33.735 --> 00:38:34.803
(Snail Guesthouse)

00:38:34.804 --> 00:38:36.574
You should go home too.

00:38:39.235 --> 00:38:41.375
How much longer will you neglect your own problems and feel lost?

00:38:42.744 --> 00:38:44.145
Go and tell your father...

00:38:44.775 --> 00:38:45.974
that you like being in a band...

00:38:46.715 --> 00:38:47.915
and that you don't want to study abroad.

00:38:48.784 --> 00:38:50.915
Tell him you're done being his trophy.

00:38:52.154 --> 00:38:53.554
No. I'm not leaving.

00:38:53.784 --> 00:38:55.784
I don't want to live as your trophy anymore.

00:38:56.594 --> 00:38:57.695
Then why didn't you...

00:38:58.195 --> 00:38:59.824
tell me sooner about how you felt?

00:39:00.965 --> 00:39:02.125
I knew you'd behave this way.

00:39:02.594 --> 00:39:04.133
Just like now, you're set in your ways.

00:39:04.134 --> 00:39:05.565
You still should have told me!

00:39:06.235 --> 00:39:08.235
If you had respected me as a parent,

00:39:08.764 --> 00:39:09.904
you should have done...

00:39:10.735 --> 00:39:12.235
whatever you could to persuade me.

00:39:12.634 --> 00:39:14.474
That's what a family does!

00:39:14.545 --> 00:39:16.004
How could I have persuaded you?

00:39:16.005 --> 00:39:17.775
You can't even hear my music anyway!

00:39:23.215 --> 00:39:25.054
If you tell your father, he'll understand too.

00:39:26.054 --> 00:39:27.485
He doesn't know because you never told him.

00:39:31.525 --> 00:39:32.795
When you guys all leave,

00:39:34.625 --> 00:39:36.565
my grandma will be very sad.

00:39:47.844 --> 00:39:49.174
(Grandma, I'll make dinner today. Take the day off.)

00:39:49.175 --> 00:39:50.614
Grandma, are you really going to be like this?

00:39:51.315 --> 00:39:52.774
I can't believe this.

00:39:52.775 --> 00:39:54.945
How could you like a stranger more than your own grandson?

00:39:55.045 --> 00:39:58.653
If you're going to keep talking nonsense, get out and wash up.

00:39:58.654 --> 00:40:00.054
I am not talking nonsense.

00:40:00.224 --> 00:40:01.653
You like Eun Gyeol more than me,

00:40:01.654 --> 00:40:04.494
and you and Chung Ah became best friends in just one day.

00:40:05.094 --> 00:40:06.094
You brat.

00:40:06.494 --> 00:40:09.425
He's no match for my grandson, no matter how adorable he is.

00:40:10.134 --> 00:40:12.194
Try bringing me a truck full of Shin Seong Il and his look-alikes,

00:40:12.195 --> 00:40:13.534
and see if I'd trade you for them.

00:40:15.034 --> 00:40:17.033
My gosh. I'm sorry, Mr. Tutor.

00:40:17.034 --> 00:40:18.335
Oh, don't be sorry.

00:40:18.404 --> 00:40:20.374
Why do you adore me? And how much do you adore me?

00:40:20.375 --> 00:40:23.203
Goodness. Hey, get out and wash up.

00:40:23.204 --> 00:40:24.614
I should get some sleep.

00:40:24.744 --> 00:40:26.445
Come on. Tell me.

00:40:26.684 --> 00:40:29.344
Why do you adore me so much?

00:40:32.755 --> 00:40:33.824
Oh, boy.

00:40:34.954 --> 00:40:36.454
Even though you went through so much...

00:40:38.625 --> 00:40:41.194
at such a young age,

00:40:41.195 --> 00:40:43.735
you're still a good boy...

00:40:43.934 --> 00:40:45.695
and have never once rebelled.

00:40:46.264 --> 00:40:48.034
You're not a crybaby.

00:40:49.665 --> 00:40:52.605
You're healthy, both physically and mentally. That's why I adore you.

00:40:53.574 --> 00:40:57.114
That's the best thing, you know.

00:41:04.184 --> 00:41:06.954
Well, I should sleep...

00:41:08.025 --> 00:41:09.824
next to Ms. Go Yang Hee today. It's been too long.

00:41:11.425 --> 00:41:12.795
Me too!

00:41:13.094 --> 00:41:14.493
Let me join.

00:41:14.494 --> 00:41:16.493
Hey, how dare you? She's my grandma!

00:41:16.494 --> 00:41:18.394
You guys aren't kids anymore.

00:41:18.395 --> 00:41:19.633
She's my grandma too!

00:41:19.634 --> 00:41:21.633
- Grandma, tell him to go away. - Why are you guys being like this?

00:41:21.634 --> 00:41:23.504
- She's my grandma. - Leave my grandma alone!

00:41:23.505 --> 00:41:25.534
- Hey, seriously. - My goodness.

00:41:56.364 --> 00:41:57.505
Hey, you scared me.

00:41:58.074 --> 00:41:59.134
Why are you still up?

00:41:59.675 --> 00:42:00.875
How do you know this song?

00:42:01.304 --> 00:42:03.875
What do you mean? I wrote this song.

00:42:06.074 --> 00:42:07.215
What is this?

00:42:08.014 --> 00:42:09.914
Take a listen to the song in it...

00:42:09.915 --> 00:42:11.784
and try to come up with a guitar riff for it.

00:42:12.585 --> 00:42:14.125
If I think it sounds good enough,

00:42:14.954 --> 00:42:17.554
I'll give you that guitar. I know you want it.

00:42:17.954 --> 00:42:19.054
Really?

00:42:19.494 --> 00:42:20.994
Are you really going to give me that guitar?

00:42:21.695 --> 00:42:23.993
I said, "If I think it sounds good enough."

00:42:23.994 --> 00:42:25.594
I clearly said that.

00:42:26.434 --> 00:42:27.704
The song isn't complete.

00:42:28.005 --> 00:42:29.904
It only has the main melody line for the lead guitar.

00:42:30.735 --> 00:42:32.074
Fill in the rest.

00:42:32.735 --> 00:42:35.605
But who wrote this melody?

00:42:36.474 --> 00:42:38.415
Did you write this?

00:42:39.074 --> 00:42:41.184
No, of course not.

00:42:42.545 --> 00:42:43.915
You wouldn't know even if I told you.

00:42:45.284 --> 00:42:48.184
No. No one would know.

00:42:49.284 --> 00:42:51.195
It was written by an artist no one knew.

00:42:52.994 --> 00:42:56.395
No way. Dad was the obscure artist?

00:42:57.965 --> 00:42:59.764
But how did Mr. Viva know this melody?

00:43:00.134 --> 00:43:02.134
Sorry to disturb you while you're spacing out,

00:43:02.465 --> 00:43:04.134
but can you close the door at once?

00:43:04.574 --> 00:43:06.134
Even the slightest noise can wake my grandma.

00:43:15.884 --> 00:43:17.514
You really wrote this song?

00:43:18.085 --> 00:43:20.425
Why? Are you surprised to find out that I'm such a genius?

00:43:20.985 --> 00:43:22.025
For real?

00:43:23.284 --> 00:43:25.355
Are you sure you wrote this melody yourself?

00:43:25.925 --> 00:43:27.724
I'm getting offended.

00:43:28.195 --> 00:43:29.494
Are you belittling me right now?

00:43:30.065 --> 00:43:31.895
Why? Am I not allowed to write a song?

00:43:32.264 --> 00:43:34.264
Well, it's not that.

00:43:36.134 --> 00:43:38.533
I thought we'd decided to perform "Shining" at the contest.

00:43:38.534 --> 00:43:40.204
Why are you writing a song?

00:43:45.045 --> 00:43:47.445
I'm going to leave the band once the contest is over.

00:43:47.884 --> 00:43:49.645
What? Why?

00:43:50.855 --> 00:43:52.554
So Grandma can wear my graduation hat.

00:43:54.585 --> 00:43:56.425
It's her wish, so I should make it happen.

00:43:57.494 --> 00:43:58.594
What can I do?

00:43:58.755 --> 00:44:00.363
In order to grant her wish,

00:44:00.364 --> 00:44:02.295
I'll have to study very hard for a while.

00:44:03.494 --> 00:44:04.594
And that's why...

00:44:05.494 --> 00:44:08.105
I'm dedicating this song to my radiant youth.

00:44:09.264 --> 00:44:11.034
Are you going to give up on music?

00:44:15.945 --> 00:44:17.014
Of course, I won't.

00:44:18.375 --> 00:44:21.514
I just want to compose this now, before I forget how youth felt.

00:44:22.585 --> 00:44:24.054
My next goal is...

00:44:25.715 --> 00:44:26.855
the Campus Song Festival.

00:44:30.195 --> 00:44:32.354
But the thing is, I wrote the middle part,

00:44:32.355 --> 00:44:34.925
but I don't know what to do with the beginning and end of it.

00:44:36.594 --> 00:44:39.764
Please grant his wish.

00:44:43.904 --> 00:44:45.105
Let's work on it together.

00:44:46.235 --> 00:44:47.945
Let's complete this song together.

00:44:48.704 --> 00:44:50.315
- For real? - Yes.

00:44:50.514 --> 00:44:51.944
I'd love that!

00:44:51.945 --> 00:44:54.884
But you'll have to promise me two things.

00:44:55.315 --> 00:44:56.784
Seriously? You're such a jerk.

00:44:58.014 --> 00:44:59.084
Tell me what they are.

00:44:59.085 --> 00:45:02.084
First, no one can hear this song...

00:45:02.085 --> 00:45:04.454
until you participate in the Campus Song Festival.

00:45:05.525 --> 00:45:07.295
Okay. What's the other one?

00:45:07.695 --> 00:45:11.295
Tomorrow, you won't go out. You'll just stay home all day.

00:45:13.494 --> 00:45:14.634
You're at it again?

00:45:15.505 --> 00:45:17.303
I know that you won't get it.

00:45:17.304 --> 00:45:19.634
- But I can't tell you... - Okay.

00:45:21.105 --> 00:45:22.744
- Did you just say "Okay?" - Yes.

00:45:23.105 --> 00:45:26.275
But why would you agree to it right away without asking for the reason?

00:45:26.915 --> 00:45:28.085
You're making me anxious.

00:45:28.514 --> 00:45:29.715
I thought about it...

00:45:30.614 --> 00:45:33.925
and realized that everything you had asked me to do was for my own sake.

00:45:35.654 --> 00:45:39.195
Please don't ruin his dream.

00:45:40.895 --> 00:45:43.324
Here. Get started.

00:45:45.094 --> 00:45:47.335
Please let him be happy.

00:45:47.404 --> 00:45:49.835
I can record this, right? I'm afraid I'd forget.

00:45:54.204 --> 00:45:55.775
(Record)

00:45:56.404 --> 00:45:58.014
Please help him...

00:45:59.514 --> 00:46:01.244
so his youth can keep on twinkling.

00:46:03.715 --> 00:46:05.554
If anyone's listening, please...

00:46:58.275 --> 00:47:00.445
Please grant my desperate wish.

00:47:07.085 --> 00:47:09.743
Hey, let's play together!

00:47:09.744 --> 00:47:11.354
(June 6, 1995, after Eun Gyeol's time slip)

00:47:11.355 --> 00:47:13.283
Today, we celebrated the 40th Memorial Day...

00:47:13.284 --> 00:47:15.683
after 50 years of independence.

00:47:15.684 --> 00:47:17.053
Oh, dried pollack soup!

00:47:17.054 --> 00:47:18.453
Ms. Go, you read my mind.

00:47:18.454 --> 00:47:19.794
My, this looks amazing.

00:47:19.795 --> 00:47:23.863
You guys drink all night whenever there is a holiday.

00:47:23.864 --> 00:47:25.894
Your parents back home are working themselves to the bone...

00:47:25.895 --> 00:47:29.364
- to pay for your education. - Ms. Go! Can I have some food too?

00:47:30.804 --> 00:47:33.534
You haven't eaten yet? What have you been doing?

00:47:33.744 --> 00:47:35.004
Are you hungover too?

00:47:35.005 --> 00:47:37.915
Gosh, I purposely came here on an empty stomach to eat your food.

00:47:39.715 --> 00:47:41.613
- Anyway, where is Yi Chan? - No idea.

00:47:41.614 --> 00:47:45.053
He's been stuck in his room with his guitar since yesterday.

00:47:45.054 --> 00:47:47.454
I think he's just been lounging around all day.

00:47:51.625 --> 00:47:52.724
Hey, Yi Chan!

00:47:53.025 --> 00:47:55.723
Don't make me set the table twice. Come out and eat now!

00:47:55.724 --> 00:47:56.824
My gosh.

00:47:58.235 --> 00:47:59.295
Thank you.

00:47:59.994 --> 00:48:01.234
Grandma.

00:48:01.235 --> 00:48:03.064
I was recording something very important.

00:48:03.065 --> 00:48:04.804
Your voice got recorded too!

00:48:08.775 --> 00:48:10.645
- Ma Joo, why are you here? - What?

00:48:11.045 --> 00:48:12.344
Eun Gyeol called me here.

00:48:12.974 --> 00:48:14.743
He said we'd practice here today.

00:48:14.744 --> 00:48:16.683
- Ms. Go! Can we have some food too? - Feed us too!

00:48:16.684 --> 00:48:18.154
- Feed us! - Hey, you!

00:48:18.755 --> 00:48:19.755
Hello!

00:48:19.756 --> 00:48:22.125
- Goodness. Thank you for the meal. - Hey, move.

00:48:22.654 --> 00:48:24.223
- Oh, boy. Thank you. - All right.

00:48:24.224 --> 00:48:25.754
- Hello! - Boys, you should've called me...

00:48:25.755 --> 00:48:28.124
to tell me that you were all coming over.

00:48:28.125 --> 00:48:29.823
- Let's go. - Hey, eat the side dishes first.

00:48:29.824 --> 00:48:31.234
- Okay! - Okay!

00:48:31.235 --> 00:48:32.295
Hey, pass me the chopsticks.

00:48:32.665 --> 00:48:34.465
You invited them over when this isn't even your house?

00:48:35.864 --> 00:48:37.704
Bal San, how do you take care of your hair?

00:48:38.175 --> 00:48:39.574
I try not to wash it often.

00:48:40.545 --> 00:48:41.743
My gosh. It's so long now.

00:48:41.744 --> 00:48:44.214
Bal San, what do you do to grow your hair so quickly?

00:48:44.215 --> 00:48:45.843
Think lots of dirty thoughts.

00:48:45.844 --> 00:48:48.343
Sung Dae, I heard your girlfriend dumped you.

00:48:48.344 --> 00:48:49.715
Yes, for thinking lots of dirty thoughts.

00:48:50.715 --> 00:48:52.614
- My goodness. - Hey, we're eating now.

00:48:53.684 --> 00:48:54.684
Gosh.

00:48:55.054 --> 00:48:57.723
I only heard that his friend regretted not going there...

00:48:57.724 --> 00:49:00.324
with Yi Chan that day and blamed himself for it.

00:49:02.465 --> 00:49:04.695
What? Got something to say to me?

00:49:07.605 --> 00:49:10.204
Stay with Yi Chan today, no matter what.

00:49:10.974 --> 00:49:14.074
No. Stay glued to him even when you get older.

00:49:14.505 --> 00:49:15.874
Never cut off contact with him.

00:49:15.875 --> 00:49:19.145
My gosh. I have to see that idiot even when I'm older?

00:49:19.974 --> 00:49:21.944
Where are you going that you're dumping this bomb on me?

00:49:21.945 --> 00:49:23.584
Hey, why are you calling me a bomb?

00:49:23.585 --> 00:49:24.784
Because you are a bomb!

00:49:24.915 --> 00:49:26.554
Don't worry. I'm not going anywhere.

00:49:27.824 --> 00:49:29.684
I'll always stay right by your side too.

00:49:34.594 --> 00:49:35.794
(The 2nd Hongdae Culture Festival)

00:49:35.795 --> 00:49:38.065
Come and check out these oriental melons.

00:49:39.094 --> 00:49:41.464
- I can't pinpoint the exact time, - Oriental melons!

00:49:41.465 --> 00:49:44.304
- but we can narrow it down. - Fresh oriental melons are here.

00:49:44.474 --> 00:49:46.375
All right. Come and try it.

00:49:46.474 --> 00:49:48.343
When their late lunch begins at the guesthouse,

00:49:48.344 --> 00:49:49.474
we'll start the countdown.

00:49:50.514 --> 00:49:52.473
Okay. Then just in case,

00:49:52.474 --> 00:49:54.184
I'll go to the scene in the morning and wait there.

00:49:54.445 --> 00:49:56.343
As soon as the lunch begins,

00:49:56.344 --> 00:49:57.884
leave me a voicemail message.

00:49:58.014 --> 00:49:59.014
Okay.

00:49:59.514 --> 00:50:00.924
The same goes for the site of the accident.

00:50:00.925 --> 00:50:02.255
We can narrow it down.

00:50:02.724 --> 00:50:04.553
When Yi Chan is visiting White Night Music,

00:50:04.554 --> 00:50:06.224
he normally takes this route.

00:50:06.355 --> 00:50:08.494
And this is the only road with street vendors.

00:50:09.195 --> 00:50:10.263
The accident...

00:50:10.264 --> 00:50:12.594
(Hardware store, used bookstore, cafe)

00:50:13.134 --> 00:50:14.835
It'll most likely take place here.

00:50:16.335 --> 00:50:18.004
- These huge oriental melons... - Hello.

00:50:18.005 --> 00:50:20.504
- Yes, hello. - They look so fresh.

00:50:20.505 --> 00:50:22.044
- Can I get this one? - Sure.

00:50:22.045 --> 00:50:23.605
- That one? - Yes.

00:50:27.215 --> 00:50:28.445
Could you give me this for free?

00:50:29.844 --> 00:50:31.553
There are many cars here, so it's dangerous.

00:50:31.554 --> 00:50:33.484
Where's your mom? I'll take you to your mom.

00:50:33.485 --> 00:50:34.854
Why are you doing this?

00:50:34.855 --> 00:50:35.884
No!

00:50:36.154 --> 00:50:38.994
Wait! It's dangerous here with all the cars around.

00:50:42.795 --> 00:50:44.594
- Shoot. - Hey, it splashed on me.

00:50:44.864 --> 00:50:47.633
Sorry. How did I drop it?

00:50:47.634 --> 00:50:50.033
- Darn it. - It splashed all over the place!

00:50:50.034 --> 00:50:51.403
I said we should start the meeting.

00:50:51.404 --> 00:50:55.275
Why did you have to go and bring the juice?

00:50:57.344 --> 00:50:59.074
Hey, I'll get it.

00:51:06.514 --> 00:51:07.553
Hello?

00:51:07.554 --> 00:51:08.724
How could you drink and drive?

00:51:08.884 --> 00:51:10.484
Did you want to get someone killed?

00:51:10.485 --> 00:51:11.554
It's me.

00:51:11.625 --> 00:51:13.324
Are you all right? Are you not hurt?

00:51:13.654 --> 00:51:14.764
Congratulations, Ha Eun Gyeol.

00:51:16.094 --> 00:51:17.195
It's all over.

00:51:17.534 --> 00:51:18.934
I checked, with my own eyes.

00:51:20.264 --> 00:51:22.764
Yi Chan is safe now.

00:51:27.505 --> 00:51:28.675
Thanks, On Eun Yu.

00:51:29.675 --> 00:51:31.344
I told you to trust your helper.

00:51:33.474 --> 00:51:34.645
Do you want to come over?

00:51:35.585 --> 00:51:36.945
Everyone's here.

00:51:38.085 --> 00:51:39.154
I want to see you.

00:51:39.585 --> 00:51:40.925
Okay, I'll join you guys.

00:51:41.184 --> 00:51:42.585
After checking one more thing.

00:51:42.855 --> 00:51:44.755
You still have to check something?

00:51:44.855 --> 00:51:48.295
Well, just to satisfy my personal curiosity.

00:51:48.925 --> 00:51:50.494
(White Night)

00:51:55.204 --> 00:51:58.835
Who was the person that visited my grandfather that day?

00:52:05.844 --> 00:52:07.383
(White Night)

00:52:07.384 --> 00:52:08.915
(Used Musical Instruments)

00:52:18.654 --> 00:52:21.264
So, Mom was that visitor?

00:52:42.645 --> 00:52:43.915
Taxi!

00:52:49.824 --> 00:52:52.924
Sir, could you follow that taxi? Please hurry.

00:52:52.925 --> 00:52:54.125
Do not lose it.

00:52:54.494 --> 00:52:55.925
I can't guarantee you anything.

00:52:57.434 --> 00:52:59.594
There was a time when I felt lost too.

00:53:00.195 --> 00:53:02.134
Whatever. I bet you were just pretending.

00:53:02.735 --> 00:53:05.073
No, I swear. I'm telling you the truth.

00:53:05.074 --> 00:53:08.104
I ran away from home, just once.

00:53:08.105 --> 00:53:09.945
You ran away from home? You?

00:53:10.145 --> 00:53:11.175
Yes.

00:53:11.675 --> 00:53:13.973
I believe it was shortly after I'd moved to the US.

00:53:13.974 --> 00:53:17.814
I ran away and came back to Korea without telling your grandparents.

00:53:17.815 --> 00:53:20.755
My gosh. What was the first thing you did once you came back?

00:53:21.125 --> 00:53:22.255
I met my biological father.

00:53:26.994 --> 00:53:28.695
I had many questions for him,

00:53:29.695 --> 00:53:31.395
and there were many things I wanted to hear from him,

00:53:32.364 --> 00:53:33.665
but I couldn't say a word.

00:53:36.134 --> 00:53:37.875
The same goes for him. We just...

00:53:45.074 --> 00:53:46.445
I had a cup of tea and left.

00:53:48.585 --> 00:53:51.614
After that, I didn't see him again...

00:53:52.355 --> 00:53:53.654
until the day of his funeral.

00:53:59.195 --> 00:54:01.625
What? Hold on. Why did you stop?

00:54:02.264 --> 00:54:05.534
Oh, boy. It'd be nice if life was like a movie.

00:54:26.054 --> 00:54:28.054
You said you'd come over. Why didn't you call me?

00:54:28.425 --> 00:54:30.085
Do you know how worried I was?

00:54:31.454 --> 00:54:32.994
I thought something had happened.

00:54:36.594 --> 00:54:37.594
What's wrong?

00:54:38.665 --> 00:54:39.934
Did something happen?

00:54:41.264 --> 00:54:42.804
I had checked everything...

00:54:43.934 --> 00:54:46.304
except for one thing, so I was feeling anxious.

00:54:47.005 --> 00:54:48.645
What was the thing you couldn't check?

00:54:49.074 --> 00:54:51.275
The person who visited White Night Music that day.

00:54:53.545 --> 00:54:55.014
So? Did you check?

00:54:58.154 --> 00:54:59.215
Who was it?

00:54:59.585 --> 00:55:01.054
Is it someone I know?

00:55:09.195 --> 00:55:10.195
My mom.

00:55:11.134 --> 00:55:12.134
Choi Se Gyeong.

00:55:16.034 --> 00:55:19.604
Hey! Get up, will you?

00:55:19.605 --> 00:55:21.045
Aren't we going to talk about the arrangement?

00:55:21.704 --> 00:55:24.004
We can wait until Eun Gyeol is back, can't we?

00:55:24.005 --> 00:55:26.945
Hey, you guys won't get any work done once Se Gyeong gets here.

00:55:28.614 --> 00:55:29.743
Get up right now!

00:55:29.744 --> 00:55:32.085
- I feel so lazy. - Let's take a break.

00:55:32.675 --> 00:55:35.085
Hey, Yi Chan. Where is the recording of the demo track?

00:55:38.355 --> 00:55:39.414
Is that it?

00:55:42.255 --> 00:55:43.824
Gosh.

00:56:02.275 --> 00:56:04.545
- No! - Gosh, you scared me.

00:56:05.545 --> 00:56:07.113
This song cannot be revealed to anyone.

00:56:07.114 --> 00:56:08.144
What?

00:56:08.414 --> 00:56:11.354
Are you two planning to participate in a different contest without us?

00:56:11.355 --> 00:56:12.384
I'm not like you.

00:56:12.385 --> 00:56:14.013
Did you copy someone else's song?

00:56:14.014 --> 00:56:15.453
Do you have a death wish?

00:56:15.454 --> 00:56:18.525
Composed by Ha Yi Chan and Ha Eun Gyeol. We wrote it together.

00:56:19.094 --> 00:56:20.524
Then why can't it be revealed?

00:56:20.525 --> 00:56:21.663
You don't need to know.

00:56:21.664 --> 00:56:23.465
Stop prying, or you'll get hurt.

00:56:24.795 --> 00:56:26.594
Hey, this is great.

00:56:26.864 --> 00:56:30.134
I was anxious about competing against Ilyoung High with one song.

00:56:30.135 --> 00:56:31.234
I have a good feeling about this.

00:56:31.235 --> 00:56:32.904
"A Song for You."

00:56:32.905 --> 00:56:34.274
Yes, I like it too.

00:56:34.275 --> 00:56:36.774
It'll stand out among all the rock songs.

00:56:36.775 --> 00:56:38.544
We'll have a greater chance of winning with this.

00:56:38.545 --> 00:56:41.214
Hey, are your ears all clogged?

00:56:41.215 --> 00:56:42.283
Did you not hear what I said?

00:56:42.284 --> 00:56:44.314
I cannot reveal this song.

00:56:44.315 --> 00:56:46.114
I promised Eun Gyeol that I wouldn't!

00:56:47.315 --> 00:56:48.823
- Then... - Yes.

00:56:48.824 --> 00:56:50.124
Get him!

00:56:50.125 --> 00:56:51.524
- Hey! - Take it away from him!

00:56:51.525 --> 00:56:53.654
- Hold him. - Grab it! Hurry up!

00:56:53.655 --> 00:56:55.723
- No! - I'll ask Mr. Jonathan...

00:56:55.724 --> 00:56:57.124
which song is better.

00:56:57.125 --> 00:57:00.064
- Hey. Darn you! - Keep him here for ten minutes.

00:57:00.065 --> 00:57:01.763
- Okay, got it. - Ma Joo! Hold on.

00:57:01.764 --> 00:57:05.735
- Let go of me! - Hey, calm down.

00:57:08.105 --> 00:57:09.175
But I don't get it.

00:57:09.974 --> 00:57:11.714
Why did she suddenly come back from the US?

00:57:11.715 --> 00:57:14.985
More importantly, why did your mother go to White Night Music?

00:57:15.485 --> 00:57:16.744
Because he's my maternal grandfather.

00:57:17.545 --> 00:57:18.585
What?

00:57:18.985 --> 00:57:22.855
Mr. Jonathan at White Night Music is my maternal grandfather.

00:57:23.454 --> 00:57:24.695
What are you talking about?

00:57:25.454 --> 00:57:27.594
Your maternal grandfather is a physics professor.

00:57:28.425 --> 00:57:31.894
He is my mom's adoptive father.

00:57:32.635 --> 00:57:34.933
If you don't mind me asking,

00:57:34.934 --> 00:57:38.105
how did you know Mr. Viva?

00:57:39.304 --> 00:57:40.335
I'm his daughter.

00:57:45.114 --> 00:57:46.144
Hey, what's wrong?

00:57:47.244 --> 00:57:48.385
The two of us...

00:57:50.885 --> 00:57:52.014
have met in the past.

00:57:52.715 --> 00:57:54.724
What? Us?

00:57:55.485 --> 00:57:56.554
When?

00:57:56.885 --> 00:57:58.425
The day when your mother...

00:57:58.994 --> 00:58:01.764
gave me the guitar your grandfather had left behind for me.

00:58:11.204 --> 00:58:12.235
She's good, isn't she?

00:58:13.974 --> 00:58:16.045
She's my daughter. She wants to be a cellist.

00:58:16.204 --> 00:58:17.844
She's 18 too, just like you.

00:58:18.744 --> 00:58:19.744
And...

00:58:21.545 --> 00:58:23.184
we met at his funeral too.

00:58:23.315 --> 00:58:25.255
(In Mourning)

00:58:31.594 --> 00:58:33.824
(Viva Music)

00:58:46.034 --> 00:58:48.244
That boy was you?

00:58:49.175 --> 00:58:50.175
Yes.

00:58:51.574 --> 00:58:54.715
But what were you doing at my grandfather's funeral?

00:58:55.815 --> 00:58:57.385
He was my mentor.

00:58:57.784 --> 00:58:58.784
What?

00:58:59.614 --> 00:59:01.925
He saved me when I was being bullied in school.

00:59:03.385 --> 00:59:05.224
He was the one who taught me music...

00:59:07.824 --> 00:59:10.065
and taught me what "CODA" meant.

00:59:14.735 --> 00:59:17.005
I must go meet him now.

00:59:18.105 --> 00:59:19.175
Hey.

00:59:28.744 --> 00:59:30.184
Oh Ma Joo!

00:59:30.715 --> 00:59:32.815
- Shoot. - Hey, wait!

00:59:33.554 --> 00:59:35.524
Hand it over while I'm still talking nicely to you.

00:59:35.525 --> 00:59:37.484
You really can't do this.

00:59:37.485 --> 00:59:39.795
I promised him to make sure no one would hear it.

00:59:39.954 --> 00:59:40.954
Hey!

00:59:41.695 --> 00:59:44.663
It's too late. We have all heard the song already!

00:59:44.664 --> 00:59:45.735
Gosh.

00:59:46.494 --> 00:59:47.564
Hey!

00:59:47.565 --> 00:59:50.663
Eun Gyeol will flip out if he finds out that I left the house.

00:59:50.664 --> 00:59:53.804
Since when did you do exactly as he said?

00:59:55.744 --> 00:59:56.744
Oh.

00:59:58.545 --> 00:59:59.574
Shoot.

01:00:02.045 --> 01:00:04.683
Your father is paging you, right? Go and be a good son.

01:00:04.684 --> 01:00:05.914
Hey, wait!

01:00:06.855 --> 01:00:08.284
For real, okay?

01:00:08.385 --> 01:00:10.384
You know I'm not doing this for my own sake.

01:00:10.385 --> 01:00:13.154
So let's go and ask Mr. Jonathan.

01:00:13.155 --> 01:00:14.723
Ask him which song is better.

01:00:14.724 --> 01:00:16.965
- Hey, I can't... - You are our front man!

01:00:19.195 --> 01:00:20.195
I'm counting on you.

01:00:20.795 --> 01:00:22.965
(White Night)

01:00:32.074 --> 01:00:33.275
Gosh.

01:00:46.855 --> 01:00:49.795
(Viva Music)

01:00:59.905 --> 01:01:00.974
Dry yourself.

01:01:01.204 --> 01:01:02.804
You'll catch a cold if you stay like that.

01:01:06.445 --> 01:01:07.445
It's okay.

01:01:07.644 --> 01:01:09.344
Stuff like that can happen in your youth.

01:01:14.755 --> 01:01:16.155
I can't believe I had no idea.

01:01:25.934 --> 01:01:28.304
I can't believe I didn't recognize Mr. Viva.

01:01:43.344 --> 01:01:44.413
Oh, no.

01:01:44.414 --> 01:01:47.014
- Gosh, is he okay? - Call 911!

01:02:11.105 --> 01:02:13.374
("A Song for You")

01:02:13.375 --> 01:02:16.884
Special thanks to Ha Eun Gyeol.

01:02:16.885 --> 01:02:18.084
("A Song for You")

01:02:18.085 --> 01:02:19.884
Thanks to you, I was able to complete this song.

01:02:19.885 --> 01:02:21.323
(Song by Ha Yi Chan and Ha Eun Gyeol)

01:02:21.324 --> 01:02:22.655
Looking back, I realized...

01:02:23.824 --> 01:02:25.925
that this song wasn't the only thing you helped me complete.

01:02:26.954 --> 01:02:28.494
When I wanted something,

01:02:29.494 --> 01:02:32.494
when I felt like I lacked something, when I was in despair,

01:02:35.605 --> 01:02:36.905
and even at my most radiant moments,

01:02:38.034 --> 01:02:39.635
you were always there with me.

01:02:42.204 --> 01:02:43.875
You lied to me that you were my son.

01:02:47.045 --> 01:02:48.114
But you know what?

01:02:51.114 --> 01:02:52.815
For some reason, I felt as though you were like my father.

01:02:55.085 --> 01:02:57.284
Even though I have never experienced a father's love,

01:03:01.664 --> 01:03:03.295
I got to experience something similar thanks to you.

01:03:09.164 --> 01:03:11.534
Son, thank you.

01:03:13.105 --> 01:03:14.204
But...

01:03:15.605 --> 01:03:17.644
in my next life, I'll be born as your father.

01:03:24.514 --> 01:03:25.684
Hey, Yi Chan!

01:03:25.885 --> 01:03:28.683
Don't make me set the table twice. Come out and eat now!

01:03:28.684 --> 01:03:29.755
My gosh.

01:03:40.434 --> 01:03:42.235
If anyone's listening, please...

01:03:44.974 --> 01:03:46.974
Please grant my desperate wish.

01:03:51.244 --> 01:03:52.244
Can you hear me?

01:03:53.815 --> 01:03:54.914
My voice.

01:03:55.985 --> 01:03:57.045
Can you hear it?

01:04:18.934 --> 01:04:20.974
I'm sorry, Dad...

01:04:23.244 --> 01:04:25.574
(The 2nd Hongdae Culture Festival)

01:04:29.344 --> 01:04:35.355
We met while wandering

01:04:36.755 --> 01:04:41.864
Through time

01:04:43.864 --> 01:04:50.534
Among the countless people

01:04:51.235 --> 01:04:56.905
I recognized you

01:05:29.375 --> 01:05:34.274
(Twinkling Watermelon)

01:05:34.275 --> 01:05:35.714
Wrap up your journey...

01:05:35.715 --> 01:05:37.783
and come to the place where you arrived.

01:05:37.784 --> 01:05:39.553
Do you think I can go back in this situation?

01:05:39.554 --> 01:05:40.754
Where are you going?

01:05:40.755 --> 01:05:42.485
To find the scumbag who made Yi Chan like that.

01:05:42.724 --> 01:05:45.695
Please open your eyes.

01:05:45.954 --> 01:05:47.654
I'm sure all your efforts...

01:05:47.655 --> 01:05:49.724
changed the situation for the better.

01:05:49.864 --> 01:05:52.763
So let's now return to the world where we belong.

01:05:52.764 --> 01:05:54.163
This isn't your fault.

01:05:54.164 --> 01:05:55.735
Accidents are just accidents.

01:05:56.005 --> 01:05:57.404
Don't even look back, and leave.

01:05:57.405 --> 01:05:59.004
If you decide to stay,

01:05:59.005 --> 01:06:02.573
your life in 2023 will disappear.

01:06:02.574 --> 01:06:04.144
Will you be okay with that?
