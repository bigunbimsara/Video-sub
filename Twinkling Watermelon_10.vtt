(Choi Hyun Wook)

00:00:28.141 --> 00:00:29.801
(Seol In Ah)

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.781
(Shin Eun Soo)

00:00:44.391 --> 00:00:48.159
(Twinkling Watermelon)

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.390
(Production sponsors)

00:00:49.391 --> 00:00:50.890
(Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, KOCCA)

00:00:50.891 --> 00:00:51.891
(All people, organizations, locations, and incidents...)

00:00:51.891 --> 00:00:52.891
(in this drama are fictitious.)

00:00:52.891 --> 00:00:53.891
(Staff ensured child actors' safety in the filming of this drama.)

00:00:55.031 --> 00:00:58.071
"Sorry. I shouldn't have let myself fall for you. I made a mistake."

00:00:59.501 --> 00:01:01.701
"I have a dream and goals."

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.910
"It's my dream and my family's dream too."

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:07.370
"At this stage of my life, dating someone..."

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.711
"would feel like a waste of emotion and time, which is useless."

00:01:11.711 --> 00:01:13.811
"Useless?" What?

00:01:14.211 --> 00:01:16.150
That's what Eun Ho wanted me to tell you.

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.360
Tell me yourself.

00:01:22.791 --> 00:01:24.431
I don't believe this guy.

00:01:25.031 --> 00:01:27.390
(Tell me yourself. I don't believe this guy.)

00:01:27.391 --> 00:01:28.860
I'll DM you later.

00:01:32.031 --> 00:01:34.099
Sorry. Don't contact him until he gets into college...

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.440
- Hey! - He asked me to tell you that.

00:01:50.621 --> 00:01:51.951
You selfish jerk.

00:01:58.291 --> 00:01:59.360
Shut it.

00:02:00.931 --> 00:02:03.231
(Episode 10)

00:02:12.041 --> 00:02:14.610
Four down. There's just one left now, right?

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:16.380
Hand over her number now.

00:02:17.311 --> 00:02:19.380
No way. This one, I really can't.

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.280
"No way?" What do you mean?

00:02:21.281 --> 00:02:24.021
You promised me you'd cut off contact with all of them.

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.121
Hurry up and hand it over.

00:02:27.251 --> 00:02:28.790
It's that cellist girl, right?

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.461
Hand it over. Come on.

00:02:32.831 --> 00:02:35.301
No, she's special to me.

00:02:38.831 --> 00:02:41.741
This is such a critical time for you. Don't you know that?

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:44.740
Getting into college won't be easy...

00:02:44.741 --> 00:02:46.871
even if you're focused solely on the training.

00:02:47.711 --> 00:02:50.040
You need to start seriously thinking about your future.

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.450
You're doing this for your own future, not mine.

00:02:54.051 --> 00:02:55.121
What?

00:02:55.281 --> 00:02:58.051
I need to achieve my dream for you to free yourself from this burden.

00:02:59.051 --> 00:03:00.091
Eun Ho.

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.931
Eun Gyeol, just live your life.

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.200
I'll figure out what to do with my own life.

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:15.871
From time to time, let yourself enjoy the moment.

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.811
Let yourself fall in love, like me.

00:03:19.611 --> 00:03:22.009
Don't waste your youth because of me or the family...

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.380
because you can never get back your youth.

00:03:25.081 --> 00:03:26.880
Let yourself twinkle while you can.

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:29.751
Do things that make your heart flutter.

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.591
It won't make your world come crashing down.

00:04:01.681 --> 00:04:02.880
You've grown up to be a fine young man.

00:04:04.081 --> 00:04:06.690
Do you want to come in for a moment? I have something to give you.

00:04:13.061 --> 00:04:16.001
My gosh. Abstinence can be charming.

00:04:17.001 --> 00:04:18.301
Your self-restraint is impressive.

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:22.040
I must be going crazy.

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.639
Ms. Choi gave me Mr. Viva's guitar.

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.640
I should thank her if anything. What was I doing, just now?

00:04:27.311 --> 00:04:30.440
Come on. It's okay.

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:32.980
The embarrassment will keep you up at night for a month.

00:04:32.981 --> 00:04:34.350
But after that, you'll forget it in no time.

00:04:34.351 --> 00:04:35.820
Embarrassing memories are precious too, you see.

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:41.960
My gosh. It's okay.

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:43.720
Having a crush on someone is a valuable experience too,

00:04:43.721 --> 00:04:45.061
like your first love.

00:04:45.791 --> 00:04:47.960
And be honoured that I'm your crush.

00:04:49.301 --> 00:04:52.330
Do you remember, Eun Ho? That day, you told me...

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.700
that life didn't have to be perfect for it to shine.

00:04:57.041 --> 00:04:58.971
It's the little moments that make your life twinkle,

00:04:59.411 --> 00:05:00.541
and happiness is...

00:05:00.741 --> 00:05:03.380
what you experience when those moments come together.

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:07.280
But be honest with me.

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:09.421
Can I really let myself twinkle from time to time?

00:05:09.621 --> 00:05:10.819
I bet you've never dated.

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:13.150
Can I let myself follow my heart from time to time?

00:05:13.421 --> 00:05:15.520
You've never dated, right? I knew it!

00:05:16.061 --> 00:05:17.760
Would my world really not come crashing down?

00:05:18.361 --> 00:05:21.431
Look at you, you've never dated

00:05:21.601 --> 00:05:23.030
You've never dated

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:07.210
Hey.

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:09.681
Well...

00:06:11.481 --> 00:06:12.481
That portrait.

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:16.121
Is that me?

00:06:26.231 --> 00:06:27.231
But why?

00:06:30.061 --> 00:06:31.101
Don't tell me...

00:06:33.431 --> 00:06:35.041
Hey, do you...

00:06:39.111 --> 00:06:40.111
like me?

00:07:12.241 --> 00:07:13.640
- Hey, you know... - Hey.

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:16.940
- You go first. - You go first.

00:07:18.911 --> 00:07:20.351
- Or shall I... - Shall I go first?

00:07:24.721 --> 00:07:26.791
- About earlier... - Let's pretend it never happened.

00:07:28.361 --> 00:07:30.491
Yes, I get it.

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:33.760
This weather, the moist air, and this romantic ambience.

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:35.699
All these things...

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:38.101
provoked your dirty mind.

00:07:39.371 --> 00:07:41.231
"Dirty mind?" What?

00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:44.301
It's okay. I really understand.

00:07:44.741 --> 00:07:47.069
Well, let's just pretend it never happened...

00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:49.041
and keep some distance from each other.

00:07:52.911 --> 00:07:54.981
Always stay at least 5m away from me, okay?

00:07:56.681 --> 00:07:58.020
Why should I do that?

00:07:58.520 --> 00:07:59.791
You know why.

00:07:59.991 --> 00:08:02.860
You cheated to steal the ball from Yi Chan.

00:08:02.861 --> 00:08:05.860
Like I said, I want to be fair to you both until the festival...

00:08:05.861 --> 00:08:07.460
You're not entirely wrong,

00:08:08.361 --> 00:08:09.760
but you're building up walls around you.

00:08:11.161 --> 00:08:12.770
I'm a little offended.

00:08:14.101 --> 00:08:15.570
Of course, I...

00:08:16.541 --> 00:08:18.411
I can't say I'm not partially responsible.

00:08:18.811 --> 00:08:21.879
Gosh, boys at age 18 are like beasts.

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:24.080
I admit that I let my guard down.

00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:26.580
Then I'll knock 2m off.

00:08:26.681 --> 00:08:28.551
Always stay at least 3m away from me, okay?

00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:34.921
- About what happened earlier... - Okay, fine.

00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:37.861
Always stay at least 2m away from me. End of discussion.

00:08:38.130 --> 00:08:39.161
Bye.

00:08:58.611 --> 00:09:01.410
This is nuts. I must be losing my mind!

00:09:01.581 --> 00:09:04.220
"About what happened earlier?" What were you going to say?

00:09:04.221 --> 00:09:05.950
That you're sorry? That it was a mistake?

00:09:05.951 --> 00:09:08.321
That it was part of your mission or something? If not that...

00:09:21.331 --> 00:09:22.441
If not that,

00:09:25.211 --> 00:09:26.410
what was it?

00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:30.010
What happened earlier.

00:09:41.691 --> 00:09:42.691
What's up?

00:09:43.191 --> 00:09:45.331
What is it? Where are we going?

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:03.180
What do those signs mean?

00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:05.650
(What do those signs mean?)

00:10:07.810 --> 00:10:10.981
It means, "Don't go. Stay with me."

00:10:14.221 --> 00:10:16.121
Why do you ask? Did someone say that to you?

00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:20.130
Then what about this?

00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:25.670
"Thank you for saving me."

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:28.770
"And I'm sorry."

00:10:29.571 --> 00:10:32.640
"I didn't know that you were the one who saved me."

00:10:33.571 --> 00:10:34.770
It was Yi Chan, wasn't it?

00:10:38.211 --> 00:10:40.111
Yi Chan said that. Am I right?

00:10:43.751 --> 00:10:44.991
It's a green light.

00:10:47.290 --> 00:10:49.121
I want to learn sign language.

00:10:51.361 --> 00:10:53.130
So I can make friends.

00:10:53.731 --> 00:10:55.259
You'll teach me, right?

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:56.900
(You'll teach me, right?)

00:11:03.101 --> 00:11:05.910
Yes. I'll teach you.

00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:08.211
I'll do my very best.

00:11:25.731 --> 00:11:28.660
So it's been a few days. Are you enjoying working as a live-in tutor?

00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:30.201
Yes, it's been good.

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:32.300
You remember the promise you made me, right?

00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:36.240
Let me say it again. I'll have to see results in a month.

00:11:36.241 --> 00:11:37.571
If not, there will be consequences.

00:11:37.971 --> 00:11:41.040
Please don't worry. I always keep my promises.

00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:42.981
I'll look forward to it, then.

00:11:43.711 --> 00:11:45.581
- You can go. - Yes, sir.

00:11:52.621 --> 00:11:54.221
Do you have something else to say?

00:11:55.721 --> 00:11:58.429
Sir, you have a business trip coming up.

00:11:58.430 --> 00:12:00.790
Why don't you bring back a fax machine as a gift for your daughter?

00:12:03.501 --> 00:12:06.731
I saved you, and you're now telling me what to do?

00:12:07.501 --> 00:12:09.799
If you buy her a fax machine as a gift,

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:11.841
she can use it to communicate with the world.

00:12:12.471 --> 00:12:15.111
It could also help you achieve the results you want more quickly.

00:12:15.241 --> 00:12:18.280
I suppose you haven't learned what it means to overstep boundaries.

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:21.650
I just meant that it could maximize your gains, which is what you like.

00:12:22.221 --> 00:12:23.280
All right, then.

00:12:29.321 --> 00:12:31.691
Why should I accept your request?

00:12:32.491 --> 00:12:34.691
I'm a businessman. I never take on deals that could result in losses.

00:12:35.331 --> 00:12:38.060
When I give 1 thing, I always gain at least 2 things.

00:12:38.701 --> 00:12:41.701
What could you offer if I were to accept your request?

00:12:42.201 --> 00:12:43.571
What could you give me?

00:12:54.581 --> 00:12:55.920
Her smile.

00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:57.920
What?

00:12:59.290 --> 00:13:01.550
I'll show you your daughter's smile.

00:13:02.091 --> 00:13:03.491
Not a fake one.

00:13:03.890 --> 00:13:06.491
A real smile. The kind you can only see when someone's truly happy.

00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:46.300
What?

00:13:52.611 --> 00:13:54.971
I'm leaving this here as I must stay at least 2m away from you.

00:13:55.410 --> 00:13:57.379
I washed it for you while filling up gas...

00:13:57.380 --> 00:13:58.810
and fixed a few things too.

00:14:00.581 --> 00:14:02.050
Of course, he has to tell me he did these things.

00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:04.649
Today's temperature, humidity level, ambience,

00:14:04.650 --> 00:14:07.851
and the whole universe wish you a wonderful day.

00:14:18.530 --> 00:14:19.930
Do you want to practice?

00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:25.140
"I want to be your friend."

00:14:27.571 --> 00:14:31.341
"I want to get to know you better."

00:14:33.211 --> 00:14:34.310
Well done.

00:14:51.971 --> 00:14:54.371
It's very nice to see the two of you on your way to school together.

00:14:55.770 --> 00:14:58.471
Can you spare me a moment before your class?

00:14:59.071 --> 00:15:02.111
(Seowon Arts High School)

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:10.981
Eun Gyeol.

00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:13.451
Yes, ma'am.

00:15:14.451 --> 00:15:15.591
Am I a joke to you?

00:15:16.691 --> 00:15:17.721
Pardon me?

00:15:17.991 --> 00:15:20.029
I clearly told you that you weren't allowed...

00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:21.361
to use sign language in my house.

00:15:21.861 --> 00:15:24.101
I'd like to know your reason, one that I can understand.

00:15:26.371 --> 00:15:28.900
The family has its own education method.

00:15:29.941 --> 00:15:31.940
I can confidently say that it is the best way to raise Chung Ah...

00:15:31.941 --> 00:15:33.441
like a non-deaf person.

00:15:34.441 --> 00:15:36.010
Are you sure that is the only reason?

00:15:36.341 --> 00:15:37.680
What other reason could there be?

00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:41.711
Perhaps, you're deliberately isolating Chung Ah...

00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:44.650
and trying to make sure she can't communicate with Chairman Yoon...

00:15:45.321 --> 00:15:46.491
to get something.

00:15:49.721 --> 00:15:51.461
Jinsung Musical Instruments, for example.

00:16:00.430 --> 00:16:02.941
You seem to think that you're holding on to a sturdy rope.

00:16:03.841 --> 00:16:04.941
But you see...

00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:09.481
How many days out of the year do you think the chairman comes home?

00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:12.081
So when he's not around to see what's going on,

00:16:15.751 --> 00:16:18.221
you've been abusing Chung Ah in places he can't see?

00:16:18.890 --> 00:16:19.991
How dare you!

00:16:20.621 --> 00:16:22.420
That statement is considered slander.

00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:26.430
If I abused Chung Ah,

00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:29.130
how come the chairman has never once heard about it?

00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:32.770
There are many eyes and mouths in the household.

00:16:35.170 --> 00:16:38.539
All our employees believe in my education philosophy and obey...

00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:40.410
They keep their lips sealed because you pay them.

00:16:45.581 --> 00:16:47.481
I have that much insight.

00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:51.821
If you're thinking of suggesting the same thing to me,

00:16:52.991 --> 00:16:54.221
I must decline.

00:16:55.861 --> 00:16:57.390
If you have nothing else to say...

00:16:57.461 --> 00:16:58.831
The Guidance Committee...

00:16:59.630 --> 00:17:01.660
has decided to take the disciplinary action up a notch.

00:17:02.961 --> 00:17:05.201
You'll have to clean the school for a month...

00:17:05.501 --> 00:17:07.130
instead of attending your classes.

00:17:07.630 --> 00:17:09.770
But I was already told to submit letters of apology and volunteer...

00:17:14.910 --> 00:17:16.581
Are you doing this to get back at me?

00:17:18.211 --> 00:17:20.110
So I can't help Chung Ah study?

00:17:26.850 --> 00:17:29.891
Have you heard the idiom about the fox using the tiger's power?

00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:40.330
Darn it.

00:17:43.870 --> 00:17:46.941
The fox acted up, believing that the tiger had its back.

00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:50.741
What happened to the fox in the end?

00:17:51.711 --> 00:17:53.050
It survived,

00:17:53.981 --> 00:17:55.310
and it was not foolish.

00:17:56.981 --> 00:17:59.320
I believe the contract you signed with the chairman is for a month.

00:17:59.921 --> 00:18:01.751
You'd better leave before that.

00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:06.660
I'm sorry, but Chairman Yoon is my employer, not you.

00:18:06.661 --> 00:18:07.731
Leave.

00:18:11.231 --> 00:18:13.530
Move out of my house and leave my school.

00:18:14.131 --> 00:18:16.140
I don't care who you really are and what you're truly after.

00:18:16.141 --> 00:18:17.671
Go back to where you came from.

00:18:19.741 --> 00:18:20.840
Mark my words.

00:18:22.641 --> 00:18:24.110
If you ignore my warning,

00:18:24.741 --> 00:18:26.450
you'll witness the miserable demise...

00:18:26.451 --> 00:18:28.780
of the arrogant fox firsthand.

00:18:34.151 --> 00:18:36.320
Gosh, this really is nuts.

00:18:36.961 --> 00:18:39.760
I can't leave until my job here is done.

00:18:40.030 --> 00:18:42.200
Besides, I need to know how I can go back...

00:18:42.201 --> 00:18:44.600
to decide whether or not to go back.

00:18:45.530 --> 00:18:47.030
Darn it.

00:19:01.651 --> 00:19:02.721
What is this?

00:19:48.290 --> 00:19:50.400
- Hello? - Good day!

00:19:50.401 --> 00:19:51.730
You've got to be kidding me!

00:19:51.731 --> 00:19:54.631
Goodness. How scary. Are you a tiger or something?

00:19:55.030 --> 00:19:57.740
Gosh. Why are you so angry today?

00:19:57.741 --> 00:19:59.441
How could I not be angry?

00:19:59.671 --> 00:20:01.269
You call me whenever you want...

00:20:01.270 --> 00:20:02.680
and always hang up on me.

00:20:02.681 --> 00:20:04.609
I can't even reach you when I need you.

00:20:04.610 --> 00:20:07.509
All right, calm down. Let's talk it out.

00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:08.681
"Talk it out?" As if!

00:20:09.181 --> 00:20:11.550
You'll just say things that sound like riddles anyway.

00:20:11.651 --> 00:20:13.049
You never once answered my questions...

00:20:13.050 --> 00:20:14.891
or did me a favour.

00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:18.119
Oh, no. I guess you needed my help.

00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:20.461
If I did, so what?

00:20:20.661 --> 00:20:21.930
It's not like you'd help me.

00:20:21.931 --> 00:20:24.430
I'm not such a terrible person, you see.

00:20:24.431 --> 00:20:25.770
My goodness.

00:20:28.501 --> 00:20:30.600
Then please tell me when my dad's accident took place.

00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:33.539
You're still obsessed with the problems involving your parents.

00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:35.981
When and where did the accident take place? And why did it happen?

00:20:36.741 --> 00:20:39.850
Can't you stop obsessing over it and start enjoying your youth?

00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:45.381
Do not contact me again.

00:20:46.850 --> 00:20:47.921
I'm just going to...

00:20:48.191 --> 00:20:50.020
figure out what to do on my own.

00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:51.620
Too bad.

00:20:51.721 --> 00:20:53.859
Actually, I found and sent...

00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:56.201
the perfect helper for you.

00:20:56.431 --> 00:20:58.430
But you want to figure things out on your own,

00:20:58.431 --> 00:20:59.769
so you do that. Bye.

00:20:59.770 --> 00:21:01.770
No, hold on. Wait!

00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:04.701
"Helper?" Who's that?

00:21:04.901 --> 00:21:06.110
Go softer.

00:21:10.911 --> 00:21:12.381
Gradually increase the volume.

00:21:33.131 --> 00:21:35.741
For some strange reason, they seem to have good chemistry.

00:21:36.141 --> 00:21:38.001
They resemble each other in some peculiar ways.

00:21:39.310 --> 00:21:41.110
They say people look alike when they're in love.

00:21:55.691 --> 00:21:56.721
Se Gyeong.

00:21:57.620 --> 00:21:58.661
Choi Se Gyeong?

00:22:01.631 --> 00:22:02.661
Choi Se Gyeong.

00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:04.660
Yes?

00:22:04.661 --> 00:22:07.230
What were you thinking about? I called your name several times.

00:22:07.231 --> 00:22:08.299
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:10.241
I'm still having a hard time adjusting to the time difference.

00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:12.941
Come on out and delight our ears. It's been too long.

00:22:13.270 --> 00:22:14.310
Sir.

00:22:14.610 --> 00:22:16.809
I was told to just observe the classes for the time being.

00:22:16.810 --> 00:22:18.140
That's why I didn't bring my cello.

00:22:18.141 --> 00:22:20.610
Guys, can one of you let her borrow your cello?

00:22:21.550 --> 00:22:22.620
Here.

00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:05.860
(Our Deepest Condolences)

00:23:08.691 --> 00:23:11.431
You must be devastated, but be mature about it and get over it.

00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:12.829
You don't want people to say you won...

00:23:12.830 --> 00:23:15.131
first place by default because of a friend who took her own life.

00:23:20.171 --> 00:23:22.171
Gosh, sir.

00:23:22.510 --> 00:23:24.540
Here. I'm sorry.

00:23:25.010 --> 00:23:27.580
I need to run to the restroom now.

00:23:28.050 --> 00:23:30.681
Gosh, I apologize. I'm sorry.

00:23:50.471 --> 00:23:51.870
Don't let your mind falter.

00:23:52.641 --> 00:23:53.671
But...

00:23:54.211 --> 00:23:56.280
remember these emotions you're feeling now...

00:23:57.741 --> 00:24:00.881
so you can think of them when you're playing sad music later on.

00:24:29.711 --> 00:24:30.711
What's she doing?

00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:32.141
I can't hear it.

00:24:32.610 --> 00:24:33.650
(The 47th Seokwang Music Competition)

00:24:33.651 --> 00:24:34.751
I hear no sound.

00:24:36.181 --> 00:24:38.020
I can't hear anything!

00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:45.221
Too bad.

00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:47.230
Actually, I found and sent...

00:24:47.231 --> 00:24:49.431
the perfect helper for you.

00:24:52.671 --> 00:24:53.731
"Helper?"

00:25:12.891 --> 00:25:13.921
Dad?

00:25:14.550 --> 00:25:15.651
What's going on?

00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:23.401
There's one condition.

00:25:27.070 --> 00:25:29.171
To receive help from your helper,

00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:34.211
you must help them first.

00:25:56.800 --> 00:26:02.671
Your silence

00:26:04.570 --> 00:26:09.280
Makes my lips dry

00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:16.020
The cold look in your eyes

00:26:20.421 --> 00:26:21.451
What should I do?

00:26:21.891 --> 00:26:22.961
What should I say?

00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:25.661
She'll be hurt if I reject her.

00:26:26.691 --> 00:26:28.161
But I should still be honest, right?

00:26:29.131 --> 00:26:31.431
I'm sorry, but there's someone I like...

00:26:35.971 --> 00:26:37.040
It's for me?

00:26:40.570 --> 00:26:41.941
Hey, wait. Chung Ah!

00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:54.691
I know you like Se Gyeong.

00:26:59.491 --> 00:27:00.590
It doesn't matter though,

00:27:01.191 --> 00:27:02.231
because...

00:27:05.131 --> 00:27:07.631
(You own your feelings, and I own mine.)

00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:12.100
You own your feelings,

00:27:15.411 --> 00:27:17.211
and I own mine.

00:27:29.491 --> 00:27:32.090
But we can still be friends.

00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:38.731
If you don't want to be my friend because of my disability...

00:27:38.901 --> 00:27:39.971
It's not that.

00:27:43.001 --> 00:27:44.539
Then you're a jerk.

00:27:44.540 --> 00:27:46.671
I'll just spit on you and walk away,

00:27:46.810 --> 00:27:48.040
so feel free to reject me.

00:27:54.510 --> 00:27:57.921
Can we be friends?

00:28:03.391 --> 00:28:10.931
As I was turning around

00:28:11.201 --> 00:28:17.901
Instead of telling me that you loved me

00:28:19.070 --> 00:28:20.971
You said, "Goodbye"

00:28:22.711 --> 00:28:24.510
Goodbye

00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:31.881
The one word that got me choked up

00:28:33.891 --> 00:28:39.431
Because our love

00:28:41.691 --> 00:28:47.330
Wasn't meant

00:28:48.431 --> 00:28:52.171
To last

00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:15.391
Hey, when did you improve so much?

00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:17.830
You must've been practicing really hard!

00:29:18.260 --> 00:29:20.200
My gosh. Let me check your calluses.

00:29:20.201 --> 00:29:22.769
Goodness. What took you so long?

00:29:22.770 --> 00:29:24.099
I told you to come at the speed of light.

00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:25.500
Right, you said it was urgent.

00:29:25.501 --> 00:29:26.670
Why? What happened?

00:29:26.671 --> 00:29:27.941
Are you hurt?

00:29:28.110 --> 00:29:29.210
Did you get into another fight?

00:29:29.211 --> 00:29:30.640
We have to share the results of the skills test...

00:29:30.641 --> 00:29:32.580
and make our decision!

00:29:32.711 --> 00:29:35.509
Hey! You got me so worried because you said it was an emergency.

00:29:35.510 --> 00:29:36.950
I nearly had a heart attack.

00:29:36.951 --> 00:29:38.220
Choose your words mindfully.

00:29:38.221 --> 00:29:39.391
It is an emergency!

00:29:39.550 --> 00:29:41.751
The festival is right around the corner. Anyway, forget it.

00:29:42.290 --> 00:29:45.491
So? How did the test go? I have no doubt that she passed.

00:29:46.330 --> 00:29:48.160
You got to see firsthand...

00:29:48.161 --> 00:29:50.201
how talented Se Gyeong really is.

00:30:00.310 --> 00:30:01.340
I did get to see her...

00:30:02.340 --> 00:30:03.411
up close.

00:30:04.681 --> 00:30:05.681
She looked pretty.

00:30:06.510 --> 00:30:07.510
What?

00:30:07.881 --> 00:30:09.210
You little...

00:30:09.211 --> 00:30:10.779
No, it came out wrong. The photos she took!

00:30:10.780 --> 00:30:12.991
I meant to say the photos she took were pretty.

00:30:13.451 --> 00:30:15.090
What about you?

00:30:15.451 --> 00:30:17.191
You saw Chung Ah's drawings, right?

00:30:29.231 --> 00:30:30.300
Oh...

00:30:35.971 --> 00:30:37.040
She's pretty good.

00:30:38.741 --> 00:30:39.911
I guess you do...

00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:42.411
respect the frontman after all.

00:30:43.881 --> 00:30:44.921
So can she work with us?

00:30:46.221 --> 00:30:49.589
Well, what do you say? Can Se Gyeong work with us?

00:30:49.590 --> 00:30:50.960
If Chung Ah can work with us...

00:30:50.961 --> 00:30:52.360
Yes, for sure.

00:30:54.830 --> 00:30:57.300
Nothing personal though. It's strictly business.

00:30:58.001 --> 00:30:59.870
The deal's sealed. Don't go back on your word later.

00:31:02.231 --> 00:31:03.970
All right, look here.

00:31:03.971 --> 00:31:06.539
One, two, three. Snap!

00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:07.610
You little...

00:31:07.770 --> 00:31:11.579
My. What is this, the KOREA-US summit?

00:31:11.580 --> 00:31:15.079
My gosh. I feel like a peaceful reunification is around the corner.

00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:18.180
Goodness. We don't have time to be chatting away like this.

00:31:18.181 --> 00:31:20.451
Oh, you're right. Let's get going. We'll be late.

00:31:20.850 --> 00:31:21.891
Where are we going?

00:31:22.451 --> 00:31:23.860
- All right. - Goodness.

00:31:24.060 --> 00:31:25.320
Someone wants to see us.

00:31:25.921 --> 00:31:26.931
Who?

00:31:28.131 --> 00:31:29.860
The almighty landlord.

00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:34.731
The kind helper who is letting us use this practice room.

00:31:36.641 --> 00:31:37.671
"Helper?"

00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:40.010
(White Night)

00:31:40.741 --> 00:31:42.270
Finally, we're here.

00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:44.940
What? This place is...

00:31:44.941 --> 00:31:46.650
Hey, why are you standing there?

00:31:46.651 --> 00:31:47.911
Sorry, I'm coming.

00:31:48.181 --> 00:31:49.211
Hurry!

00:31:52.921 --> 00:31:54.690
Sir, we're here!

00:31:54.691 --> 00:31:56.490
- It's good to see you guys. - Hello.

00:31:56.491 --> 00:31:58.620
- Yes, hi. - Hello!

00:31:59.290 --> 00:32:00.991
- Oh. - My gosh.

00:32:01.290 --> 00:32:04.130
It's you, right? The boy who came to buy a guitar for his dad.

00:32:04.131 --> 00:32:07.201
My gosh. I was wondering, but you actually own this building?

00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:09.900
Anyway, why didn't you come back?

00:32:09.901 --> 00:32:12.040
I had found a nice guitar for you.

00:32:12.241 --> 00:32:16.610
Oh, I had a complicated situation.

00:32:16.741 --> 00:32:19.211
Why? You couldn't reconcile with your dad?

00:32:19.651 --> 00:32:21.350
He doesn't want to start a band with you anymore?

00:32:21.610 --> 00:32:22.810
How did you know?

00:32:26.451 --> 00:32:27.550
You have a dad?

00:32:29.921 --> 00:32:32.020
Yes, I do.

00:32:34.191 --> 00:32:35.560
But he's very immature.

00:32:35.991 --> 00:32:38.060
My gosh. How rude.

00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:41.030
I bet you rebelled against him and ran away from home.

00:32:41.501 --> 00:32:44.200
Go home and behave yourself, you idiot.

00:32:44.201 --> 00:32:47.069
If you want to rebel, do it while eating home-cooked meals.

00:32:47.070 --> 00:32:49.780
Even if you want to fight, at least make sure you sleep in a warm room.

00:32:49.981 --> 00:32:51.810
Do it at home, okay?

00:32:52.711 --> 00:32:53.711
Don't you worry.

00:32:53.810 --> 00:32:55.451
I'll go back as soon as my job here is done.

00:32:56.881 --> 00:32:58.380
I'm doing my best.

00:32:58.381 --> 00:33:01.019
Yes, keep trying your best and be a good son.

00:33:01.020 --> 00:33:03.020
Sir, why did you call us here today?

00:33:03.620 --> 00:33:05.490
I can order more food for you guys, so eat up.

00:33:05.491 --> 00:33:06.931
- Thank you! - Thank you!

00:33:10.330 --> 00:33:13.200
Hyun Yul, do you still fight with Jindo dogs?

00:33:13.201 --> 00:33:14.530
No way.

00:33:14.731 --> 00:33:16.799
These days, you can get arrested for touching the Natural Treasures.

00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:17.840
My goodness.

00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:21.070
Sir, how do you and Hyun Yul know each other?

00:33:21.211 --> 00:33:23.880
I think Hyun Yul and I met when he was...

00:33:23.881 --> 00:33:25.040
in the Hongdae indie scene.

00:33:25.911 --> 00:33:26.911
Yes.

00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:29.780
He taught the leader of my band.

00:33:30.751 --> 00:33:32.921
Really? What did he teach him?

00:33:33.191 --> 00:33:34.191
Guitar.

00:33:34.491 --> 00:33:37.160
Oh, I should've properly introduced him sooner.

00:33:37.161 --> 00:33:39.160
In his prime,

00:33:39.161 --> 00:33:41.029
he took the entire indie band scene by storm...

00:33:41.030 --> 00:33:42.890
with his guitar alone.

00:33:42.891 --> 00:33:44.230
He's like a legend.

00:33:44.231 --> 00:33:46.231
- Oh, my! - My gosh!

00:33:46.330 --> 00:33:47.500
That's so cool.

00:33:47.501 --> 00:33:50.200
A legend? No. It's all in the past.

00:33:50.201 --> 00:33:51.270
Come on.

00:33:51.401 --> 00:33:53.741
Oh, sir. This guy here is a good guitarist.

00:33:54.570 --> 00:33:57.140
When I heard him play the guitar for the first time, I was shocked...

00:33:57.141 --> 00:33:58.780
because it sounded similar to his style.

00:33:58.941 --> 00:33:59.981
Really?

00:34:00.181 --> 00:34:01.779
Can I hear it sometime?

00:34:01.780 --> 00:34:04.580
Gosh, Hyun Yul was just exaggerating.

00:34:05.181 --> 00:34:08.191
I'd love to hear you play the guitar, sir.

00:34:09.391 --> 00:34:11.519
These days, all I can do is sand the guitars.

00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:13.860
My fingers aren't flexible anymore, so I can no longer play.

00:34:14.590 --> 00:34:17.131
Could he be the "helper" Master was talking about?

00:34:17.830 --> 00:34:20.770
If he is, what can he help me with?

00:34:21.671 --> 00:34:24.370
The practice room? Musical advice?

00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:27.111
But that's not the kind of help I want.

00:34:27.910 --> 00:34:31.180
Anyway, he should be here soon.

00:34:32.410 --> 00:34:33.481
Is someone else joining us?

00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:36.211
I want to introduce you to someone.

00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:39.380
Meet him, and he'll help you guys out...

00:34:39.381 --> 00:34:41.591
for many years to come. Consider him a helper.

00:34:41.751 --> 00:34:42.790
"Helper?"

00:35:01.740 --> 00:35:03.140
Who is the helper?

00:35:03.540 --> 00:35:04.910
You must've heard of him.

00:35:05.180 --> 00:35:07.810
The genius guitarist of the century from Chuncheon.

00:35:08.580 --> 00:35:12.481
Yoon Dong Jin.

00:35:16.251 --> 00:35:17.720
Come on in, Dong Jin.

00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:21.231
It's been a while.

00:35:21.691 --> 00:35:23.260
It's good to see you here.

00:35:23.261 --> 00:35:25.400
- Hello. - Hello.

00:35:25.401 --> 00:35:27.429
- Come here. - Take a seat.

00:35:27.430 --> 00:35:29.130
- You can sit here. - You can sit here.

00:35:29.131 --> 00:35:30.801
Bring a glass for him.

00:35:31.370 --> 00:35:34.010
- Have you eaten? - Yes, I have. Look at the time.

00:35:34.011 --> 00:35:35.770
- Just give me a glass of beer. - All right.

00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:40.450
Your jaw might drop.

00:35:41.981 --> 00:35:45.050
Sit down. I have a turtle neck syndrome. It's hard to look up.

00:35:45.051 --> 00:35:47.220
Sit down. He said he had a turtle neck syndrome.

00:35:48.551 --> 00:35:50.160
That's cute.

00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:58.600
So you're a school band?

00:35:58.830 --> 00:35:59.929
- Yes. - Yes.

00:35:59.930 --> 00:36:01.099
Who is the frontman?

00:36:01.100 --> 00:36:02.200
- It's him. - It's him.

00:36:10.281 --> 00:36:11.711
Go.

00:36:15.151 --> 00:36:16.180
Hey.

00:36:21.620 --> 00:36:23.520
What was it? Why was Dong Jin there?

00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:26.361
What was it? Is Dong Jin the helper?

00:36:27.131 --> 00:36:30.231
What was it? Did we run away when the legend showed himself?

00:36:31.001 --> 00:36:32.301
It's your fault.

00:36:32.531 --> 00:36:34.199
If you hadn't lied that day,

00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:36.369
they would've not thought that we were tricksters.

00:36:36.370 --> 00:36:39.870
Wait. We can't get out of it just by hiding.

00:36:42.511 --> 00:36:43.680
Oh, gosh.

00:36:44.580 --> 00:36:45.711
Did you hear that?

00:36:45.810 --> 00:36:48.881
He said he would've taken a bath if he had known beforehand.

00:36:49.111 --> 00:36:51.220
You're loving it.

00:36:51.350 --> 00:36:53.390
- Can I hold your hand once? - Sure.

00:36:53.850 --> 00:36:56.789
You were like a dragon in a legend,

00:36:56.790 --> 00:36:58.890
a unicorn in my imagination.

00:36:59.220 --> 00:37:02.330
Thank you so much for paying a visit.

00:37:03.801 --> 00:37:05.861
I want to be your orb.

00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:08.370
Bite me when you're bored.

00:37:09.270 --> 00:37:10.699
I want to be your horn.

00:37:10.700 --> 00:37:12.100
Please touch me once.

00:37:12.301 --> 00:37:14.011
All right.

00:37:14.410 --> 00:37:16.809
Keep going with the band.

00:37:16.810 --> 00:37:19.881
You can contact me whenever you need musical advice.

00:37:20.180 --> 00:37:22.781
Dong Jin, with that being said,

00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:27.691
can you perform at our school festival and kill it?

00:37:28.390 --> 00:37:29.450
Just once.

00:37:30.620 --> 00:37:33.290
Well... Just keep it to yourself.

00:37:34.461 --> 00:37:35.660
I...

00:37:36.091 --> 00:37:38.900
"High school students," "a band," "festival."

00:37:38.901 --> 00:37:41.100
I hate the combination of the three.

00:37:41.901 --> 00:37:44.040
- Why? - Some high school band boys...

00:37:44.501 --> 00:37:46.571
conned him recently.

00:37:47.970 --> 00:37:49.981
What kind of punks swindle you?

00:37:50.080 --> 00:37:51.179
What do they look like?

00:37:51.180 --> 00:37:53.080
I'm going to find them and crush their faces.

00:37:53.140 --> 00:37:54.349
Mr. Kang Hyun Yul.

00:37:54.350 --> 00:37:56.280
Yes? That's me.

00:37:56.281 --> 00:37:57.481
Pick up the phone. It's for you.

00:37:58.051 --> 00:37:59.080
Who is it?

00:37:59.421 --> 00:38:02.350
Please excuse me for a moment.

00:38:06.990 --> 00:38:08.031
Hyun Yul?

00:38:09.961 --> 00:38:11.761
Listen up to what I say from now on.

00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:15.869
Don't ever let Dong Jin find out who we are. Never.

00:38:15.870 --> 00:38:18.401
You must be out of your mind.

00:38:18.571 --> 00:38:21.211
You should do anything to charm him right now. What are you talking...

00:38:25.841 --> 00:38:28.511
So what's the name of your school again?

00:38:28.910 --> 00:38:30.020
It's Baekwang High School.

00:38:32.151 --> 00:38:34.850
Baekwang High School?

00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:39.520
What's the name of your band?

00:38:39.821 --> 00:38:41.760
We're First Lo...

00:38:41.761 --> 00:38:44.230
We're First Luck.

00:38:44.231 --> 00:38:45.761
- Yes. - First Luck?

00:38:45.930 --> 00:38:48.000
Luck for good luck?

00:38:48.001 --> 00:38:50.341
- It's not... - That's what it is.

00:38:50.770 --> 00:38:53.540
Luck is important when you start for the first time.

00:38:54.540 --> 00:38:56.881
Dong Jin. I'm so sorry.

00:38:57.341 --> 00:38:59.341
Something urgent came up.

00:38:59.981 --> 00:39:01.250
So we should go.

00:39:01.251 --> 00:39:02.409
I'm sorry.

00:39:02.410 --> 00:39:03.781
- Dong Jin. - I said to get out.

00:39:04.781 --> 00:39:07.120
- Hey. - Okay. I got it.

00:39:07.950 --> 00:39:10.520
You conned him.

00:39:18.761 --> 00:39:20.099
I should've known better when the name of the band...

00:39:20.100 --> 00:39:21.700
was First Love Memory Manipulators.

00:39:23.171 --> 00:39:25.270
I could've become a dragon's orb.

00:39:26.571 --> 00:39:28.640
I could've become a unicorn's horn.

00:39:29.111 --> 00:39:30.881
- It's over for us now. - It's over for us now.

00:39:31.711 --> 00:39:34.650
Well, things happened. Let's just change the name of the band.

00:39:34.651 --> 00:39:35.781
- Gosh. - My goodness.

00:39:38.751 --> 00:39:40.120
They say a crisis is an opportunity.

00:39:40.620 --> 00:39:43.719
Let's start anew in the new space with the new name.

00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:45.591
For goodness' sake.

00:39:45.821 --> 00:39:46.930
It's too late.

00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:50.060
We already signed up for the festival as The Manipulators.

00:39:50.761 --> 00:39:52.300
I believe in your negotiation skills.

00:39:52.301 --> 00:39:54.230
What about the T-shirts we made already?

00:39:54.231 --> 00:39:55.329
We can start over.

00:39:55.330 --> 00:39:57.599
What about the posters and pamphlets with "The Manipulators" on them?

00:39:57.600 --> 00:39:58.900
We can make them again too.

00:39:58.901 --> 00:40:01.040
We don't have time.

00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:03.841
When will we design and make them?

00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:06.010
Moreover, it's an exam period for Bal San.

00:40:06.011 --> 00:40:07.310
So we can't even ask him for a new design.

00:40:12.151 --> 00:40:13.220
We have a capable designer...

00:40:14.120 --> 00:40:15.990
called Yoon Chung Ah.

00:40:19.921 --> 00:40:22.031
We also have a talented photographer called Choi Se Gyeong.

00:40:22.390 --> 00:40:24.631
What about money? Are you going to steal from someone?

00:40:24.761 --> 00:40:27.429
I received the tutoring fee in advance.

00:40:27.430 --> 00:40:30.140
Did you see that? If you push the wall, it becomes a bridge.

00:40:30.370 --> 00:40:32.071
If you fall somewhere, there will be a hidden treasure.

00:40:32.401 --> 00:40:34.171
That's what my grandma always said.

00:40:36.810 --> 00:40:39.111
Gosh, you have amazing resilience.

00:40:39.881 --> 00:40:41.481
So what's the name of the band?

00:40:42.611 --> 00:40:45.450
Let us each think of one before the next practice session.

00:40:45.620 --> 00:40:48.020
But we should think it through...

00:40:48.890 --> 00:40:50.090
and decide by majority vote.

00:40:50.091 --> 00:40:52.361
I don't know. Okay. Let's do it.

00:40:54.531 --> 00:40:57.631
So who is going to tell the designer and the photographer?

00:40:59.301 --> 00:41:02.571
Eun Gyeol can talk to Chung Ah as they're living together.

00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:05.170
- As for Se Gyeong... - Rock-paper-scissors.

00:41:05.171 --> 00:41:07.369
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

00:41:07.370 --> 00:41:09.140
Yes!

00:41:16.950 --> 00:41:18.481
(Alprazolam)

00:42:03.830 --> 00:42:05.231
Why are you here at this hour?

00:42:07.501 --> 00:42:09.930
I just have something to tell you. So don't say it's a foul.

00:42:11.441 --> 00:42:12.800
- Say it. - First,

00:42:12.801 --> 00:42:14.570
you became the photographer for our band. Congratulations.

00:42:14.571 --> 00:42:16.570
Second, the name of our band will change. Just know that.

00:42:16.571 --> 00:42:18.039
Third, we're going to discuss the theme in the practice room...

00:42:18.040 --> 00:42:19.040
this Saturday.

00:42:19.041 --> 00:42:20.580
Don't forget and don't be late. I'm done. Bye.

00:42:25.781 --> 00:42:26.950
Are you sick?

00:42:28.350 --> 00:42:29.421
You look...

00:42:31.220 --> 00:42:32.321
pale.

00:42:33.830 --> 00:42:36.961
I'm not pale. I'm just fair.

00:42:37.801 --> 00:42:39.100
You're narcissistic. Bye.

00:42:40.370 --> 00:42:41.430
Hey.

00:42:45.841 --> 00:42:47.211
Can you spare me a moment?

00:42:48.941 --> 00:42:50.211
Did he...

00:42:50.611 --> 00:42:53.680
practice rock-paper-scissors all the time?

00:42:54.151 --> 00:42:55.910
He's good at everything.

00:42:57.481 --> 00:42:58.520
Darn it.

00:42:59.850 --> 00:43:01.350
(The Day)

00:43:03.251 --> 00:43:04.591
(The Day)

00:43:07.290 --> 00:43:09.660
But we can still be friends.

00:43:14.330 --> 00:43:18.441
(The Day)

00:43:20.470 --> 00:43:22.139
- Hello. - Oh, you came.

00:43:22.140 --> 00:43:23.469
- Yes. - The new issue...

00:43:23.470 --> 00:43:24.540
of "Slam Dunk" isn't here yet.

00:43:24.881 --> 00:43:26.111
I'm not here for that.

00:43:26.540 --> 00:43:28.551
Do you have any books on sign language?

00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:29.711
Sign language?

00:43:30.421 --> 00:43:31.980
Over there. Check the shelves toward the end.

00:43:31.981 --> 00:43:33.551
You might find a few books there.

00:43:34.120 --> 00:43:35.120
I'll go and check.

00:43:36.220 --> 00:43:37.490
Is sign language trending these days?

00:44:00.310 --> 00:44:01.751
Where are we going?

00:44:04.881 --> 00:44:06.020
Where are we going?

00:44:06.520 --> 00:44:07.691
(Namdaemun Liquor Store)

00:44:10.790 --> 00:44:12.860
Hey, I get that life is tough.

00:44:12.861 --> 00:44:14.231
But you shouldn't drink alcohol or smoke.

00:44:14.330 --> 00:44:15.460
What are you talking about?

00:44:15.461 --> 00:44:16.591
I'm here to exchange foreign currency.

00:44:17.031 --> 00:44:19.031
- Exchange what? - Come with me.

00:44:19.901 --> 00:44:20.901
Hey.

00:44:26.501 --> 00:44:29.640
Come on. It's not counterfeit.

00:44:29.711 --> 00:44:32.440
If you give me a good rate, I'll only come to your store.

00:44:32.441 --> 00:44:34.680
I have a lot of dollars at home.

00:44:36.711 --> 00:44:38.220
I'm giving you a good rate because you're pretty.

00:44:38.421 --> 00:44:39.481
Thank you.

00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:41.091
(Ten-dollar bill)

00:44:49.160 --> 00:44:50.901
Queen of Cello, my foot.

00:44:51.100 --> 00:44:52.961
You're a pro at this.

00:44:53.301 --> 00:44:55.329
Why did you bring me here?

00:44:55.330 --> 00:44:57.070
For the minimum safety measure.

00:44:57.071 --> 00:44:58.200
Not as your sidekick?

00:44:58.600 --> 00:44:59.969
If a young girl walks around streets like this alone...

00:44:59.970 --> 00:45:01.469
with wads of money,

00:45:01.470 --> 00:45:03.611
as a worst-case scenario, 1 of these 2 things usually happens.

00:45:03.711 --> 00:45:05.910
She either gets conned or ends up in danger.

00:45:06.680 --> 00:45:09.010
It was a misjudgement on my part to use a guy who can't even curse...

00:45:09.011 --> 00:45:10.551
as my bodyguard, though.

00:45:11.120 --> 00:45:12.551
What a nice way to thank me...

00:45:12.850 --> 00:45:14.551
when I came all the way here for you.

00:45:15.251 --> 00:45:17.789
"Hey, I get that life is tough."

00:45:17.790 --> 00:45:19.191
"But you shouldn't drink alcohol or smoke."

00:45:20.191 --> 00:45:21.460
Are you a boomer?

00:45:21.461 --> 00:45:23.530
Besides, when the lady was giving me a bad rate,

00:45:23.531 --> 00:45:25.200
you just stood there and said, "Okay."

00:45:25.631 --> 00:45:26.700
Are you an idiot?

00:45:28.401 --> 00:45:30.671
- I'll learn how to curse. - Forget it.

00:45:30.841 --> 00:45:33.040
Now that I found my go-to lady, I can come here alone next time.

00:45:33.470 --> 00:45:34.769
You'll come back here?

00:45:34.770 --> 00:45:36.440
I told you. I have a lot of dollars at home.

00:45:36.441 --> 00:45:38.179
Where did you get that much cash?

00:45:38.180 --> 00:45:40.710
I sold my cello because I'd rather die than play it.

00:45:40.711 --> 00:45:42.450
- You too? - "You too?"

00:45:43.310 --> 00:45:44.519
What did you sell?

00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:46.380
A guitar. Where did you sell it to?

00:45:46.381 --> 00:45:48.450
- At a musical instrument store. - This can't be.

00:45:49.251 --> 00:45:50.591
Is she my helper?

00:45:51.020 --> 00:45:52.290
Where was the store?

00:45:52.490 --> 00:45:53.760
Was it in front of Hongdae?

00:45:53.761 --> 00:45:56.130
No. I sold it in the US.

00:45:56.131 --> 00:45:57.960
The store handled classical instruments.

00:45:57.961 --> 00:45:59.231
I see.

00:45:59.731 --> 00:46:02.200
You should go now. Thanks for coming here with me,

00:46:02.330 --> 00:46:04.100
although you weren't much of a help.

00:46:04.441 --> 00:46:05.841
Hey, where are you going? You should go home.

00:46:06.401 --> 00:46:08.441
Gosh, where are you going?

00:46:09.441 --> 00:46:11.410
When I sold the cello, the owner told me...

00:46:11.511 --> 00:46:14.111
to go on a trip at least before I died.

00:46:14.651 --> 00:46:16.410
It wasn't a bad idea.

00:46:16.751 --> 00:46:18.950
There was a place I wanted to go alone.

00:46:19.180 --> 00:46:20.821
Happy now? Bye.

00:46:25.861 --> 00:46:27.430
(Noodles)

00:46:31.330 --> 00:46:32.361
All right.

00:46:50.251 --> 00:46:53.551
What do you think about this drawing for your band T-shirts?

00:46:54.620 --> 00:46:57.461
Gosh. You've been thinking about our shirts.

00:46:59.591 --> 00:47:02.131
You want to put this drawing on our T-shirts?

00:47:08.470 --> 00:47:09.930
It's a painting by Frida Kahlo.

00:47:10.470 --> 00:47:12.071
She's my favourite painter.

00:47:14.910 --> 00:47:15.970
I see.

00:47:17.310 --> 00:47:20.011
Why do you like her?

00:47:22.211 --> 00:47:23.211
She's strong.

00:47:24.220 --> 00:47:25.281
What?

00:47:28.191 --> 00:47:29.949
She was beautiful when facing pain.

00:47:29.950 --> 00:47:31.560
She was strong to the end.

00:47:32.321 --> 00:47:34.860
Life tortured her endlessly.

00:47:34.861 --> 00:47:37.301
But she showed life what she was made of with this painting.

00:47:43.970 --> 00:47:46.171
With this watermelon painting? How?

00:47:50.711 --> 00:47:53.540
Try to find out yourself. It's hidden in the painting.

00:47:56.881 --> 00:47:57.921
In the painting?

00:48:11.531 --> 00:48:13.600
What could it be?

00:48:16.801 --> 00:48:17.841
I see.

00:48:19.470 --> 00:48:22.671
"Viva la Vida."

00:48:25.981 --> 00:48:27.080
What does this mean?

00:48:28.910 --> 00:48:31.220
"Long live life."

00:48:48.700 --> 00:48:49.801
The other way around?

00:48:52.770 --> 00:48:54.310
I see. Like this? Sorry.

00:48:58.080 --> 00:49:00.040
After many years had passed,

00:49:00.551 --> 00:49:01.850
my father told me this one day.

00:49:02.751 --> 00:49:04.720
Thanks to the saying he learned from Mom,

00:49:04.881 --> 00:49:06.850
he was able to endure the hardships of his life.

00:49:08.591 --> 00:49:11.261
In happy or painful moments,

00:49:11.921 --> 00:49:14.390
he remembered that saying as if it were a song.

00:49:32.810 --> 00:49:34.611
The place you wanted to come alone...

00:49:34.751 --> 00:49:36.051
was this double feature theatre?

00:49:37.180 --> 00:49:38.881
No. Not really.

00:49:39.620 --> 00:49:41.591
There aren't any theatres like this where I'm from.

00:49:41.921 --> 00:49:42.990
I was just curious.

00:49:45.790 --> 00:49:47.120
Stop thinking about that.

00:49:47.961 --> 00:49:49.060
About what?

00:49:50.091 --> 00:49:51.231
About dying.

00:49:57.470 --> 00:49:59.171
Did you really come back to Korea to die?

00:50:11.520 --> 00:50:12.620
But you won't die.

00:50:13.350 --> 00:50:15.720
You'll be happy with a daughter who's as rebellious as you.

00:50:16.051 --> 00:50:18.990
You will age beautifully, gracefully, and elegantly.

00:50:19.490 --> 00:50:20.560
On top of that,

00:50:21.430 --> 00:50:23.490
you will change the fate of a boy.

00:50:24.600 --> 00:50:26.160
How do you know that?

00:50:26.531 --> 00:50:28.330
I saw that in the future.

00:50:34.341 --> 00:50:35.870
Everyone just goes on with their lives...

00:50:36.611 --> 00:50:39.881
while giving meaning to their lives or trying to find meaning.

00:50:40.410 --> 00:50:42.350
They do their best to rationalize their lives.

00:50:44.651 --> 00:50:46.821
You don't have to try so hard to be impressive.

00:50:48.220 --> 00:50:50.961
Continuing to live is already a great feat.

00:50:53.990 --> 00:50:55.231
But who knows?

00:50:56.430 --> 00:50:57.901
Besides, aren't you a little curious...

00:50:58.631 --> 00:51:02.171
about the kind of luck that will come your way in the future...

00:51:02.901 --> 00:51:04.801
and how your story will go?

00:51:07.640 --> 00:51:08.671
On that note,

00:51:11.540 --> 00:51:13.180
you should live until the festival.

00:51:15.180 --> 00:51:16.781
Why until the festival?

00:51:16.950 --> 00:51:17.981
Because...

00:51:19.381 --> 00:51:21.421
I'm going to be really cool at the festival.

00:51:23.591 --> 00:51:25.921
Gosh. You're ridiculous.

00:51:26.020 --> 00:51:27.761
You're really not shy about tooting your own horn.

00:51:35.001 --> 00:51:36.900
He said it out of gratitude when he was happy.

00:51:36.901 --> 00:51:38.970
But it became a swear word when he was suffering.

00:51:58.591 --> 00:52:00.191
At times, it was like thanking the deity.

00:52:07.671 --> 00:52:08.901
I got a fax machine.

00:52:22.651 --> 00:52:24.580
At times, it was like chanting a spell to lift a curse.

00:52:26.680 --> 00:52:28.620
Viva la Vida!

00:52:28.821 --> 00:52:30.220
Let's talk often now.

00:52:39.600 --> 00:52:42.801
My father told me with a smile that that's what he said to the world.

00:52:44.671 --> 00:52:47.511
"Viva la Vida." Long live life.

00:52:50.441 --> 00:52:51.481
- Watermelon? - Watermelon?

00:52:52.211 --> 00:52:53.679
Hey, are you talking about the green fruit...

00:52:53.680 --> 00:52:55.151
with red flesh inside?

00:52:55.410 --> 00:52:58.019
- Yes. - No way. You're joking, right?

00:52:58.020 --> 00:52:59.680
Never. I'm being serious.

00:52:59.751 --> 00:53:01.120
Have you gone mad?

00:53:01.251 --> 00:53:03.690
Hey, you want to name our band Watermelon?

00:53:03.691 --> 00:53:05.159
All right. Listen up.

00:53:05.160 --> 00:53:06.760
Her name is Frida Kahlo.

00:53:06.761 --> 00:53:09.929
She was a Mexican painter with a unibrow.

00:53:09.930 --> 00:53:12.260
For her last painting, she painted watermelons.

00:53:12.261 --> 00:53:15.200
There's a really cool saying on her painting.

00:53:15.401 --> 00:53:16.600
Do you know what it is?

00:53:16.901 --> 00:53:18.300
"Viva la Vida!"

00:53:18.301 --> 00:53:20.269
- Long live life. - Long live life.

00:53:20.270 --> 00:53:22.171
Hey, how did you know?

00:53:22.970 --> 00:53:25.780
- I'm totally on board with this. - Hey.

00:53:25.781 --> 00:53:28.010
- You're on board. Nice. - I'm on board.

00:53:28.011 --> 00:53:31.079
Hey, we can go with Viva or La Vida then.

00:53:31.080 --> 00:53:32.720
You have to be super lame...

00:53:33.120 --> 00:53:34.720
to like a name, Watermelon.

00:53:34.990 --> 00:53:37.020
Hey, let's go with our old name then.

00:53:37.191 --> 00:53:38.761
I like Watermelon.

00:53:39.220 --> 00:53:40.220
Listen.

00:53:41.231 --> 00:53:42.231
"Sweetie,"

00:53:42.861 --> 00:53:44.599
"why is your band named Watermelon?"

00:53:44.600 --> 00:53:46.001
"Well, you see,"

00:53:46.560 --> 00:53:49.600
"there was a painter named Frida Kahlo a long time ago."

00:53:50.231 --> 00:53:52.770
"She said, 'Long live life.'"

00:53:54.040 --> 00:53:55.409
Hey, doesn't it sound really cool?

00:53:55.410 --> 00:53:56.740
- That's what I'm talking about. - Right?

00:53:57.410 --> 00:53:59.111
What do you say? Should we go with it?

00:53:59.511 --> 00:54:00.809
- Go! - Go!

00:54:00.810 --> 00:54:01.810
Yes!

00:54:02.350 --> 00:54:03.381
What about you guys?

00:54:05.481 --> 00:54:06.520
Then let's use an English word...

00:54:07.180 --> 00:54:08.691
to keep the last ounce of my pride.

00:54:09.421 --> 00:54:10.421
I'm embarrassed...

00:54:11.591 --> 00:54:13.160
to call our band Watermelon.

00:54:14.160 --> 00:54:17.290
"Watermelon?" Hey, that sounds nice.

00:54:18.100 --> 00:54:19.100
Are you in?

00:54:19.361 --> 00:54:21.030
Sprinkle a lot of sugar then.

00:54:21.031 --> 00:54:22.270
So a lot of girls like our band.

00:54:24.501 --> 00:54:25.571
Watermelon Sugar?

00:54:26.600 --> 00:54:28.711
I like it! Should we go with it?

00:54:29.111 --> 00:54:30.171
- Go. - Go.

00:54:30.611 --> 00:54:33.711
Come on. I can barely hear you guys.

00:54:34.350 --> 00:54:35.551
Should we go with it?

00:54:36.881 --> 00:54:40.850
- Go! - Go!

00:54:50.231 --> 00:54:51.301
- Hey! - Hey!

00:54:53.700 --> 00:54:54.731
- Hey! - Hey!

00:54:57.231 --> 00:54:58.240
- Hey! - Hey!

00:55:00.770 --> 00:55:01.841
- Hey! - Hey!

00:55:02.671 --> 00:55:05.010
What? No way

00:55:05.011 --> 00:55:07.310
Is the sun already up?

00:55:09.611 --> 00:55:14.450
It's bright outside the window now

00:55:17.020 --> 00:55:21.990
There's a spring in my step this morning

00:55:23.861 --> 00:55:28.370
As everyone hums

00:55:31.270 --> 00:55:35.110
- They're waiting for the sunny day - They're waiting for the sunny day

00:55:35.111 --> 00:55:38.610
- With heart-fluttering sensations - With heart-fluttering sensations

00:55:38.611 --> 00:55:42.150
- The streets are full of people - The streets are full of people

00:55:42.151 --> 00:55:45.620
- Exchanging friendly glances - Exchanging friendly glances

00:55:46.651 --> 00:55:47.651
- Hey! - Hey!

00:55:50.191 --> 00:55:51.191
- Hey! - Hey!

00:55:53.720 --> 00:55:54.790
- Hey! - Hey!

00:55:57.231 --> 00:55:58.301
- Hey! - Hey!

00:55:59.200 --> 00:56:01.469
What? No way

00:56:01.470 --> 00:56:03.731
Has the night deepened already?

00:56:06.240 --> 00:56:10.870
I had no idea time flew by

00:56:11.441 --> 00:56:12.611
Hit the high notes.

00:56:13.481 --> 00:56:18.481
The white street lamp has turned on

00:56:20.520 --> 00:56:24.890
To shine the street after the sun had gone down

00:56:52.781 --> 00:56:53.781
What are you doing?

00:57:14.540 --> 00:57:15.540
Let's check that.

00:57:21.910 --> 00:57:22.910
Oh, no.

00:57:25.751 --> 00:57:26.950
Sir!

00:57:47.941 --> 00:57:48.970
Hi.

00:57:51.011 --> 00:57:52.040
Hi.

00:57:52.680 --> 00:57:53.910
Well,

00:57:54.950 --> 00:57:59.881
I hope we can work well together from now on.

00:58:02.151 --> 00:58:05.261
Actually, I'm not good at sign language.

00:58:06.220 --> 00:58:08.930
But I've been learning sign language diligently lately.

00:58:09.461 --> 00:58:11.301
I see. I didn't know.

00:58:12.100 --> 00:58:13.131
Sorry.

00:58:17.131 --> 00:58:18.140
You can do this!

00:58:21.270 --> 00:58:22.410
Let's go inside.

00:58:25.781 --> 00:58:29.510
- They're waiting for the sunny day - They're waiting for the sunny day

00:58:29.511 --> 00:58:33.050
- With heart-fluttering sensations - With heart-fluttering sensations

00:58:33.051 --> 00:58:36.519
- The streets are full of people - The streets are full of people

00:58:36.520 --> 00:58:40.290
- Exchanging friendly glances - Exchanging friendly glances

00:58:41.131 --> 00:58:42.160
- Hey! - Hey!

00:58:44.631 --> 00:58:45.660
- Hey! - Hey!

00:58:48.171 --> 00:58:49.171
- Hey! - Hey!

00:58:51.700 --> 00:58:52.700
- Hey! - Hey!

00:58:55.511 --> 00:58:57.639
Then are any of the other co-members still working...

00:58:57.640 --> 00:58:59.579
in the music industry?

00:58:59.580 --> 00:59:01.710
- No one. I'm the only one. - My gosh.

00:59:01.711 --> 00:59:02.781
- No one. I'm the only one. - My gosh.

00:59:03.450 --> 00:59:05.620
Unfortunately, we had to disband after a short while...

00:59:05.781 --> 00:59:07.781
because one of the members caused big trouble.

00:59:08.350 --> 00:59:10.550
Thanks to him, our performance at the festival was ruined.

00:59:10.551 --> 00:59:12.260
The band got disbanded.

00:59:12.261 --> 00:59:15.461
The only thing I got out of the band was my relationship with Mr. Oh.

00:59:15.830 --> 00:59:18.030
If the band got disbanded over the incident,

00:59:18.031 --> 00:59:19.731
it must have been quite serious.

00:59:22.131 --> 00:59:23.200
It was.

00:59:23.801 --> 00:59:27.770
Because of that incident, one of the members got hurt badly.

00:59:30.611 --> 00:59:31.980
(Special thanks to Yoon Do Hyun,)

00:59:31.981 --> 00:59:33.341
(Park Ho San, Kim Jun Hyung, and Park Han Sol)

01:00:00.370 --> 01:00:05.211
(Twinkling Watermelon)

01:00:05.680 --> 01:00:08.110
Dad's accident will take place tomorrow, the day of the rehearsal.

01:00:08.111 --> 01:00:10.480
Everyone, gather around. The order of the rehearsal came out.

01:00:10.481 --> 01:00:12.079
It's tomorrow at 3pm.

01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:13.949
What's his deal?

01:00:13.950 --> 01:00:15.789
Okay. I'll help you.

01:00:15.790 --> 01:00:17.820
What's going to happen tomorrow?

01:00:17.821 --> 01:00:20.190
Who's going to cause the accident? Please tell me!

01:00:20.191 --> 01:00:22.159
You've been manipulating me through Se Gyeong?

01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:24.929
Why are you taking it this far?

01:00:24.930 --> 01:00:26.960
I pleaded with you, but you wouldn't listen.

01:00:26.961 --> 01:00:28.469
I know your future.

01:00:28.470 --> 01:00:30.730
I found out how to change your life.

01:00:30.731 --> 01:00:32.940
I'll now show you the consequences...

01:00:32.941 --> 01:00:34.270
of stabbing me in the back.
