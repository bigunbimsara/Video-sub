00:00:53.065 --> 00:00:54.065
(Staff ensured child actors' safety in the filming of this drama.)

00:00:57.006 --> 00:00:58.275
(Double Espresso Frappé, Mocha Java Chip Frappé)

00:01:07.275 --> 00:01:08.345
Right.

00:01:08.786 --> 00:01:09.945
Would you like to order?

00:01:21.095 --> 00:01:22.125
Help me?

00:01:25.196 --> 00:01:26.365
Maybe they don't speak English.

00:01:27.436 --> 00:01:29.265
They must be from Japan.

00:01:32.906 --> 00:01:34.806
Welcome.

00:01:34.875 --> 00:01:36.674
(You want the same drink as last time, right?)

00:01:36.675 --> 00:01:37.675
(Yes.)

00:01:38.216 --> 00:01:40.715
(Then why are you taking so long? What about the whipped cream?)

00:01:40.716 --> 00:01:42.045
(Of course, I want that.)

00:01:42.046 --> 00:01:43.415
(Don't forget to order an extra shot for my drink.)

00:01:43.416 --> 00:01:45.484
(Are you crazy? Just drink it as it is. It's expensive.)

00:01:45.485 --> 00:01:47.624
(I know you're going to use your gift voucher here.)

00:01:47.625 --> 00:01:48.725
(What a cheapskate!)

00:01:48.755 --> 00:01:51.656
Excuse me.

00:01:51.826 --> 00:01:52.826
Well,

00:01:53.296 --> 00:01:55.966
if you could kindly write down the drinks...

00:01:56.595 --> 00:01:58.665
- you want...
- Add a lot of whipped cream...

00:01:58.666 --> 00:02:00.764
and caramel syrup for a Double Espresso Frappé.

00:02:00.765 --> 00:02:02.264
And make that a large size.

00:02:02.265 --> 00:02:05.675
And we'll also get a large Mocha Java Chip Frappé.

00:02:07.106 --> 00:02:08.175
Okay.

00:02:08.746 --> 00:02:09.845
Did you hear that?

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:11.145
(Did you order an extra shot?)

00:02:11.146 --> 00:02:12.275
Double Espresso Frappé...

00:02:12.276 --> 00:02:13.545
and extra whipped cream.

00:02:13.546 --> 00:02:16.245
I'd like an extra shot of espresso for the Double Espresso Frappé.

00:02:16.246 --> 00:02:17.686
- An extra shot.
- An extra shot.

00:02:17.785 --> 00:02:18.785
Yes, please.

00:02:31.966 --> 00:02:35.306
(Why do you want me to put these on? They're useless.)

00:02:35.565 --> 00:02:36.936
You're so clueless.

00:02:37.466 --> 00:02:40.374
You need to put them on so cars don't honk at you.

00:02:40.375 --> 00:02:42.075
They know that you can't hear them.

00:02:42.146 --> 00:02:43.945
So they will drive around you.

00:02:47.375 --> 00:02:48.545
Looking cool is a nice bonus.

00:02:56.755 --> 00:02:59.125
(Episode 1)

00:03:02.625 --> 00:03:03.996
My brother is deaf.

00:03:48.975 --> 00:03:51.176
- Hello.
- Eun Ho and Eun Gyeol are here.

00:03:51.276 --> 00:03:52.775
- Are you here for lunch?
- Yes!

00:03:52.776 --> 00:03:54.016
- Bye.
- Okay.

00:03:55.845 --> 00:03:57.384
- Hello, Eun Gyeol.
- Hello!

00:03:57.385 --> 00:03:58.415
Hey.

00:04:00.586 --> 00:04:02.026
(Cucumber-flavoured green chilli peppers)

00:04:10.325 --> 00:04:12.134
(That's dangerous! Hold on to your handles!)

00:04:12.135 --> 00:04:14.366
(Don't speed up! You might fall down!)

00:04:17.875 --> 00:04:19.736
(Don't do that.)

00:04:24.276 --> 00:04:25.815
My parents are also deaf.

00:04:29.116 --> 00:04:30.345
But I'm not.

00:04:31.555 --> 00:04:32.985
I can hear sounds.

00:04:33.855 --> 00:04:34.985
I can talk.

00:04:48.865 --> 00:04:50.506
We're out of fried chicken here.

00:04:50.966 --> 00:04:52.136
Okay. It's coming!

00:04:54.975 --> 00:04:57.276
We're serving a special meal today!

00:05:03.516 --> 00:05:05.316
(Take food only as much as you can finish.)

00:05:08.126 --> 00:05:10.256
Gosh. Look at you, Eun Gyeol.

00:05:10.925 --> 00:05:12.396
Are you helping out your parents again today?

00:05:12.725 --> 00:05:14.895
Goodness. You're such a sweet boy.

00:05:14.896 --> 00:05:17.224
- I hear you get good grades too.
- Kind of.

00:05:17.225 --> 00:05:19.636
I could raise ten sons like you.

00:05:19.735 --> 00:05:20.735
Right.

00:05:20.896 --> 00:05:21.906
Wait.

00:05:23.235 --> 00:05:25.335
- Here. Take it.
- No.

00:05:25.336 --> 00:05:26.674
My dad will scold me if I accept this.

00:05:26.675 --> 00:05:28.146
Just take it.

00:05:28.305 --> 00:05:30.975
Give us two bottles of makgeolli in return.

00:05:31.345 --> 00:05:32.415
I can't do that.

00:05:32.675 --> 00:05:33.915
If you get drunk, you might cause an accident.

00:05:34.316 --> 00:05:35.845
Everyone gets only one drink.

00:05:36.386 --> 00:05:39.315
But I'll make sure to fill it up.

00:05:39.316 --> 00:05:40.756
Okay.

00:05:44.555 --> 00:05:45.925
Delivery!

00:05:46.295 --> 00:05:48.696
- You're here.
- Hello, Eun Gyeol.

00:05:48.925 --> 00:05:51.095
Gosh. I'm so busy!

00:05:51.495 --> 00:05:53.665
Hello.

00:06:02.006 --> 00:06:04.146
(Jungkyung Mart)

00:06:09.415 --> 00:06:10.415
What's wrong?

00:06:10.416 --> 00:06:11.685
Is something wrong with the vegetables?

00:06:12.115 --> 00:06:13.456
She told you to take them back this instant.

00:06:15.586 --> 00:06:16.684
Hey. What?

00:06:16.685 --> 00:06:18.724
She said if you continued to bring us leftover produce,

00:06:18.725 --> 00:06:19.896
she wouldn't buy from this supermarket.

00:06:20.595 --> 00:06:21.626
When did I do that?

00:06:39.376 --> 00:06:42.045
She said she cooked for the people with physically demanding jobs.

00:06:42.386 --> 00:06:44.016
So she wants you to stop bringing us bad produce.

00:06:44.146 --> 00:06:46.185
Gosh. That woman. She's unbelievable.

00:06:46.516 --> 00:06:48.455
Me? When did I bring bad produce?

00:06:48.456 --> 00:06:50.626
Just because she can't talk or hear, it doesn't mean she's stupid.

00:06:51.026 --> 00:06:52.326
She told you to stop trying to trick her.

00:06:52.826 --> 00:06:54.865
She had let it go for my father's sake up until now.

00:06:55.126 --> 00:06:56.326
But she won't put up with it anymore.

00:06:57.826 --> 00:06:59.266
She'll settle the tab for this month's ingredients...

00:06:59.566 --> 00:07:01.706
based on the ingredients you bring tomorrow.

00:07:02.206 --> 00:07:05.336
Gosh. Why does it feel like you're scolding me?

00:07:05.975 --> 00:07:08.045
You're not making up the last thing you said?

00:07:08.975 --> 00:07:10.045
Are you?

00:07:13.876 --> 00:07:16.115
- Silent night - Silent night

00:07:16.816 --> 00:07:19.816
- Holy night - Holy night

00:07:20.656 --> 00:07:24.055
- All is calm - All is calm

00:07:24.586 --> 00:07:27.526
- All is bright - All is bright

00:07:28.126 --> 00:07:34.766
- Round yon Virgin, Mother and Child - Round yon Virgin, Mother and Child

00:07:35.636 --> 00:07:42.475
- Holy infant so tender and mild - Holy infant so tender and mild

00:07:43.105 --> 00:07:50.216
- Sleep in heavenly peace - Sleep in heavenly peace

00:07:50.485 --> 00:07:52.456
Merry Christmas.

00:07:53.016 --> 00:07:54.386
Merry Christmas.

00:07:54.925 --> 00:07:56.055
Why did you wake up?

00:07:56.326 --> 00:07:58.055
The choir was singing,

00:07:58.295 --> 00:08:00.025
and I could hear the sound of the snow falling.

00:08:00.026 --> 00:08:01.026
So I woke up.

00:08:01.495 --> 00:08:03.466
I thought snow didn't make any sounds.

00:08:04.126 --> 00:08:05.396
I can hear it.

00:08:05.966 --> 00:08:07.165
How does it sound?

00:08:07.966 --> 00:08:10.705
It's just like the laundry you dry in the sun.

00:08:10.706 --> 00:08:12.376
It warms my heart to hear it.

00:08:14.235 --> 00:08:16.776
Snow is cold, but its sound warms your heart?

00:08:19.016 --> 00:08:21.586
I guess you'll be a poet when you grow up, Eun Gyeol.

00:08:29.756 --> 00:08:31.355
Hey, it's snowing.

00:08:32.295 --> 00:08:34.595
Let's go out and make a snowman.

00:09:31.215 --> 00:09:32.215
Eun Ho!

00:09:35.585 --> 00:09:37.126
Mom! Dad!

00:09:37.356 --> 00:09:38.356
Mom!

00:09:50.866 --> 00:09:53.204
Mom! Dad!

00:09:53.205 --> 00:09:56.704
Eun Ho! That's going to fall! He's in danger!

00:09:56.705 --> 00:09:57.776
Hurry!

00:10:38.555 --> 00:10:40.554
I told you not to go near any building under construction...

00:10:40.555 --> 00:10:41.825
because it was dangerous.

00:10:42.656 --> 00:10:44.055
Dad saved me.

00:10:45.325 --> 00:10:47.825
What if Eun Gyeol was there with you?

00:10:52.065 --> 00:10:53.135
Dad.

00:10:53.136 --> 00:10:56.106
If Eun Ho and I were both in danger,

00:10:56.266 --> 00:10:57.965
which one of us would you save first?

00:10:59.776 --> 00:11:00.835
Dad.

00:11:01.075 --> 00:11:04.145
If Eun Ho and I were both in danger,

00:11:04.146 --> 00:11:06.175
which one of us would you save first?

00:11:09.016 --> 00:11:10.045
That sounds like a fun game.

00:11:11.516 --> 00:11:15.284
What if the three of us were in danger at the same time?

00:11:15.285 --> 00:11:16.986
Who would you save first?

00:11:27.165 --> 00:11:29.665
I regretted asking him that question.

00:11:30.006 --> 00:11:31.675
I would...

00:11:32.976 --> 00:11:35.145
After that day, his answer came to my mind...

00:11:35.146 --> 00:11:36.945
in every important moment of my life.

00:11:37.976 --> 00:11:40.116
My heart ached every time.

00:12:07.406 --> 00:12:08.675
Which floor is our house on?

00:12:30.366 --> 00:12:31.396
You're here.

00:12:33.366 --> 00:12:36.335
- Mom, the lady is here.
- You got here early.

00:12:39.406 --> 00:12:40.475
You know that...

00:12:40.476 --> 00:12:42.074
I'm renting it out at a much lower price...

00:12:42.075 --> 00:12:43.675
compared to other units in our neighbourhood, right?

00:12:44.675 --> 00:12:45.815
She said...

00:12:46.846 --> 00:12:48.945
she gave us a good deal. You know that, right?

00:12:51.386 --> 00:12:54.284
Gosh, people in the building were all against you moving in,

00:12:54.285 --> 00:12:56.954
but I personally visited every unit and convinced them.

00:12:56.955 --> 00:12:59.496
I told them you guys wouldn't be loud at least.

00:13:02.096 --> 00:13:05.534
Gosh. You see, I like the quiet.

00:13:05.535 --> 00:13:06.835
And disabled...

00:13:08.606 --> 00:13:10.965
I don't have any prejudices against people like you.

00:13:14.406 --> 00:13:15.705
She's welcoming us.

00:13:16.506 --> 00:13:17.876
She told us to move our things now.

00:13:20.915 --> 00:13:21.915
What?

00:13:25.156 --> 00:13:26.915
Why are your parents smiling at me?

00:13:27.185 --> 00:13:29.085
You didn't badmouth me, right?

00:13:29.925 --> 00:13:33.424
I didn't. I relayed your messages to them.

00:13:33.425 --> 00:13:34.895
But it was over so quickly...

00:13:34.896 --> 00:13:36.765
when I said a lot of things to your parents.

00:13:36.766 --> 00:13:39.294
If there isn't anything else you want to say,

00:13:39.295 --> 00:13:40.934
can I start moving our things?

00:13:40.935 --> 00:13:42.804
Sure. Go ahead.

00:13:42.805 --> 00:13:44.035
Bye.

00:13:51.646 --> 00:13:54.045
(Award)

00:13:58.785 --> 00:13:59.955
Oh, my.

00:14:00.185 --> 00:14:02.055
I've only heard of kids like him. He's every parent's dream!

00:14:03.986 --> 00:14:05.026
Gosh.

00:14:06.955 --> 00:14:09.295
Hey, Byung Ho. Where are you right now?

00:15:12.396 --> 00:15:15.596
Your mom and I will be coming home late quite often from now on.

00:15:16.726 --> 00:15:18.596
If there's a problem, call us right away.

00:15:18.835 --> 00:15:19.835
Okay?

00:15:24.805 --> 00:15:25.805
Once you're done with school,

00:15:25.806 --> 00:15:27.535
come to the restaurant and have lunch.

00:15:28.506 --> 00:15:31.405
You'll pack us dinner, so we'll eat that at home.

00:15:31.406 --> 00:15:33.276
We won't touch the stove at all.

00:15:33.575 --> 00:15:34.616
Right?

This one is pretty urgent.

00:15:44.486 --> 00:15:46.126
Do I have to go to the bathroom with him too?

Hello.

Can I go out with Eun Gyeol and play?

Can my brother come too?

00:16:31.606 --> 00:16:34.675
My mom told me to befriend only you because you get good grades...

This hangout is only for fourth graders.

00:16:39.646 --> 00:16:41.646
Let's play with your brother another time.

00:16:42.986 --> 00:16:44.085

all they will do is poop out of their mouths.

They're not humans. They don't understand.

00:26:54.925 --> 00:26:57.596
But instruments are different.

00:26:58.296 --> 00:27:01.265
The guitar is nothing like them.

00:27:02.366 --> 00:27:05.636
If you talk to it sincerely...

00:27:16.786 --> 00:27:19.255
It gives you a sincere answer like this.

If you talk to it sweetly...

00:27:29.056 --> 00:27:30.765

When you're excited...

00:27:42.005 --> 00:27:43.245
It gets it excited as well.

00:27:43.576 --> 00:27:45.646
Let's say you're angry.

00:27:57.255 --> 00:27:58.626
It also gets angry.

00:27:58.826 --> 00:28:01.495
What should I do to play it like you?

00:28:01.556 --> 00:28:02.924
You should learn the language.

00:28:02.925 --> 00:28:04.425
- "Language?"
- Yes.

00:28:04.596 --> 00:28:07.336
Because you should speak to this guy.

00:28:07.995 --> 00:28:10.435
Do you see these English alphabets here?

00:28:10.806 --> 00:28:12.775
These are the names of the chords.

00:28:13.505 --> 00:28:16.474
You should sing these to it 1 by 1.

00:28:16.475 --> 00:28:18.406
Not with your words, but with your hands.

00:28:19.445 --> 00:28:22.546
Then the guitar will answer...

00:28:22.745 --> 00:28:24.215
with the notes you wanted to hear.

00:28:52.745 --> 00:28:55.046
In a way, it's similar to sign language.

00:28:55.415 --> 00:28:57.014
You initiate a conversation using your hands...

00:28:57.015 --> 00:28:58.685
and hear sounds as your answer.

00:29:08.725 --> 00:29:11.325
My gosh. I'm so busy right now. Why are you here?

00:29:11.326 --> 00:29:14.795
Ma'am, I have a question for you.

00:29:14.796 --> 00:29:17.705
I heard there was a thing called the Housing Lease Protection Act.

00:29:17.965 --> 00:29:20.405
Because of it, you cannot kick out your tenants...

00:29:20.406 --> 00:29:23.745
before the lease expires even if you own the property. Is that true?

00:29:24.806 --> 00:29:26.346
Are you threatening me right now?

00:29:26.576 --> 00:29:28.244
I never said I'd kick out your family.

00:29:28.245 --> 00:29:31.546
I see. So it's true that tenants are protected by the law.

00:29:31.915 --> 00:29:32.985
Thank you.

00:29:33.185 --> 00:29:35.286
I'll let my parents know, then.

00:29:35.685 --> 00:29:36.856
Have a good day.

00:29:38.755 --> 00:29:39.924
What was that?

00:29:39.925 --> 00:29:42.095
I have so much to do. My goodness.

00:29:42.096 --> 00:29:46.435
There are major and minor chords.

00:29:46.665 --> 00:29:49.465
That's it. Then number 2. The 2nd one, right?

00:29:49.735 --> 00:29:52.335
You could say major chords sound happy,

00:29:52.336 --> 00:29:55.774
while minor chords sound sad and gloomy.

00:29:55.775 --> 00:29:57.004
Now, try it.

00:29:57.005 --> 00:29:59.174
It's not hard to be considerate of others.

00:29:59.175 --> 00:30:02.115
Just like how you're quietly listening to me...

00:30:02.116 --> 00:30:04.445
while I'm speaking now,

00:30:04.546 --> 00:30:05.944
try to put others first...

00:30:05.945 --> 00:30:09.286
Major and minor chords must coexist harmoniously...

00:30:09.626 --> 00:30:12.485
for a song to sound delightful and complete.

00:30:12.725 --> 00:30:13.796
- Idiot.
- Let's go.

00:30:17.995 --> 00:30:20.136
(Art)

00:30:21.366 --> 00:30:22.836
The same goes for life.

Experiencing hardships and joyful moments...

00:30:26.775 --> 00:30:30.075
helps you build your dazzling life.

00:30:30.076 --> 00:30:31.504
It's the slow go strumming pattern.

00:30:31.505 --> 00:30:33.244
The slow go go style. Listen carefully.

00:30:33.245 --> 00:30:35.816
One, two, three, four.

00:30:36.346 --> 00:30:37.546
Okay, here we go.

00:30:41.816 --> 00:30:42.856
A.

00:30:46.525 --> 00:30:47.525
B.

00:30:52.366 --> 00:30:55.596
By the way, what's the reason you're hiding it from your family?

00:30:56.735 --> 00:30:59.735
I just feel bad.

00:31:00.235 --> 00:31:01.535
(Viva Music)

00:31:01.536 --> 00:31:03.675
Because you can hear music, but they can't?

00:31:05.106 --> 00:31:06.146
No.

00:31:06.846 --> 00:31:09.586
Because I can play music, but they can't.

(Viva Music, Musical Instruments, Repairs, Music Lessons)

00:33:15.505 --> 00:33:16.876
Say it already.

00:33:17.745 --> 00:33:18.805
Say what?

00:33:18.806 --> 00:33:20.945
You're torn whether or not to compliment me.

00:33:24.816 --> 00:33:26.046
I'll be back in a moment.

00:33:37.465 --> 00:33:38.566
What is this?

00:33:39.866 --> 00:33:41.865
Take a listen to the song in it...

00:33:41.866 --> 00:33:44.036
and try to come up with a guitar riff for it.

00:33:44.505 --> 00:33:46.106
If I think it sounds good enough,

00:33:46.935 --> 00:33:49.606
I'll give you that guitar. I know you want it.

00:33:50.445 --> 00:33:53.346
Really? Are you really going to give me that guitar?

00:33:54.046 --> 00:33:56.545
I said, "If I think it sounds good enough."

00:33:56.546 --> 00:33:58.985
I clearly said that.

00:33:59.915 --> 00:34:01.215
The song isn't complete.

00:34:01.415 --> 00:34:03.485
It only has the main melody line for the lead guitar.

00:34:04.185 --> 00:34:05.586
Fill in the rest.

00:34:13.296 --> 00:34:14.995
(Please forgive me. I will never get a zero again.)

00:34:18.406 --> 00:34:19.435
What?

00:34:26.346 --> 00:34:28.246
What are you doing? Get lost!

00:34:29.246 --> 00:34:30.445
What are you doing?

00:34:31.445 --> 00:34:33.715
Hey!

00:34:34.686 --> 00:34:35.815
Hey, what...

00:34:36.755 --> 00:34:39.085
Hey, why are you dumping your garbage on me? Take this at once.

00:34:39.425 --> 00:34:42.625
Hey! Eun Gyeol!

00:34:43.125 --> 00:34:45.226
Hey, I told you to take this!

00:34:45.596 --> 00:34:46.596
Hey!

00:34:47.266 --> 00:34:49.096
How dare you shout? You've done nothing to be proud of!

00:34:50.065 --> 00:34:51.605
I'm adding ten more minutes.

00:34:51.866 --> 00:34:53.436
You'd better not move.

00:35:09.925 --> 00:35:10.985
Where are you going?

00:35:11.186 --> 00:35:13.456
Isn't the restaurant closed today?

00:35:14.056 --> 00:35:16.694
The people at the head office want to meet...

00:35:16.695 --> 00:35:18.025
to talk about renewing the contract.

00:35:19.666 --> 00:35:21.165
Eun Ho has a cold.

00:35:21.166 --> 00:35:22.866
He took some medicine and fell asleep.

00:35:24.706 --> 00:35:27.536
Wake him up at around 7pm and give him the fever reducer.

00:35:27.735 --> 00:35:30.075
Don't go out. Stay home and look after Eun Ho.

00:35:30.076 --> 00:35:31.675
- Okay?
- All right.

00:35:36.246 --> 00:35:37.246
See you later.

00:36:07.746 --> 00:36:10.715
But who wrote this melody?

00:36:11.516 --> 00:36:14.215
Did you write this?

00:36:15.056 --> 00:36:17.226
No, of course not.

00:36:18.525 --> 00:36:19.855
You wouldn't know even if I told you.

00:36:21.295 --> 00:36:24.226
No. No one would know.

00:36:25.295 --> 00:36:27.235
It was written by an artist no one knew.

00:37:12.476 --> 00:37:13.516
Hey!

00:37:14.775 --> 00:37:15.846
Ha Eun Gyeol!

00:37:18.116 --> 00:37:19.286
Come out!

00:37:21.386 --> 00:37:23.015
Hey, are you ignoring me right now?

00:37:23.016 --> 00:37:25.355
I'll count to three. Come out, or you're dead meat.

00:37:27.125 --> 00:37:28.195
One!

00:37:38.306 --> 00:37:39.605
Hey, loser.

00:37:39.976 --> 00:37:42.076
Why did you dump your trash on me?

00:37:45.945 --> 00:37:48.416
Throw your trash in the trash can.

00:38:25.186 --> 00:38:26.886
The person you reached is unavailable.

00:38:28.985 --> 00:38:31.826
Sir, why aren't you picking up?

00:38:32.525 --> 00:38:34.125
I already finished my homework.

00:38:34.726 --> 00:38:37.096
I'm on my way to your shop now. Please take a listen.

00:38:37.596 --> 00:38:38.895
I'm totally confident that you'll like it.

Turn off the gas and the power supply.

Get your equipment...

00:40:00.146 --> 00:40:01.675
- and follow me right in.
- Yes, sir.

00:40:08.085 --> 00:40:10.024
Gosh, someone's inside. What do we do?

00:40:10.025 --> 00:40:12.656
- Oh, no.
- Please get them out.

00:40:12.855 --> 00:40:15.295
- My goodness.
- Did the firefighters go inside?

00:40:19.025 --> 00:40:21.266
Gosh, I can't believe this.

Your kids? You're looking for your kids, right?

00:40:27.105 --> 00:40:29.174
The firefighters went inside a few moments ago.

00:40:29.175 --> 00:40:31.075
Let's wait for them to come out, okay?

00:40:31.076 --> 00:40:33.044
Oh, there they are.

00:40:33.045 --> 00:40:35.315

He has two kids.

00:40:52.965 --> 00:40:55.295
I think he's trying to tell you that the other one is still inside.

00:40:55.996 --> 00:40:57.734
- We combed through the house.
- Okay.

00:40:57.735 --> 00:40:59.465
- Tell him there was no one else.
- Really?

00:41:00.076 --> 00:41:03.275
Hey, he said there was no one else.

00:41:03.875 --> 00:41:06.045

- You can't go inside.
- Gosh, stop. Don't.

Calm down. You can't go inside.

- My goodness.
- Sorry, coming through!

What about Dad? Where's Dad?

00:42:19.315 --> 00:42:21.386

Of course, I'll do my best to save the whole family.

How could you set my house on fire?

00:44:50.766 --> 00:44:53.064
We didn't start the fire.

00:44:53.065 --> 00:44:54.604
It was because of a cigarette butt...

You know it won't be enough to cover all the repairs, right?

Did you take a look around to make sure you didn't forget anything?

Everything's burnt to ashes anyway.

00:48:45.136 --> 00:48:47.875
This is our home now. We'll live here, just the two of us.

00:48:49.605 --> 00:48:51.346
Just focus on studying music.

00:48:51.576 --> 00:48:52.746
You understand what I'm saying, right?

00:49:02.215 --> 00:49:03.355
Bring it on!

00:49:06.326 --> 00:49:08.456
Nice. That's it. Keep it up!

00:49:10.525 --> 00:49:11.625
That's it!

00:49:14.835 --> 00:49:15.936
Nice!

00:49:28.746 --> 00:49:29.775
Okay.

00:49:31.116 --> 00:49:32.116
All right, guys. Come here.

00:49:34.656 --> 00:49:35.885
Ever since he hurt...

00:49:35.886 --> 00:49:37.115
his posterior cruciate ligament at the last match,

00:49:37.116 --> 00:49:38.886
he's been faltering right before kicking.

00:49:39.386 --> 00:49:41.055
If we just leave it, it'll turn into a habit,

00:49:41.056 --> 00:49:42.195
so he should be careful for the time being.

00:49:42.425 --> 00:49:44.366
(We welcome all athletes.)

00:49:44.965 --> 00:49:46.326
He says...

00:49:46.826 --> 00:49:49.695
you should be careful because you hurt your knee in the last match.

00:49:51.036 --> 00:49:52.465
Okay, got it.

00:49:52.806 --> 00:49:54.374
Be careful, okay?

00:49:54.375 --> 00:49:55.806
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

00:49:57.036 --> 00:49:59.845
Anyway, I know you're just helping your brother practice,

00:49:59.846 --> 00:50:01.874
but you might end up participating in the tournament at this rate.

00:50:01.875 --> 00:50:03.675
You're improving by the day, Eun Gyeol.

00:50:04.516 --> 00:50:05.786
Do you want to give it a go?

00:50:06.016 --> 00:50:08.655
Maybe, after I make sure this guy wins a medal.

00:50:08.656 --> 00:50:10.314
Hey, be careful not to hurt him.

00:50:10.315 --> 00:50:11.656
Hey, guys.

00:50:12.485 --> 00:50:14.596
- Eun Gyeol!
- Ouch, sorry.

00:50:16.395 --> 00:50:19.765
Anyway, remember what Coach said,

00:50:19.766 --> 00:50:21.395
and don't miss a single physical therapy session.

00:50:21.636 --> 00:50:23.794
The national tournament is coming up,

00:50:23.795 --> 00:50:25.436
so you must keep in tip-top shape.

00:50:34.976 --> 00:50:37.416
(Looking like an idol singer.)

00:50:41.416 --> 00:50:43.885
You know it's not easy to get a good score.

00:50:43.886 --> 00:50:44.956
As for the individual match...

00:50:46.186 --> 00:50:47.455
Don't you know you must be 1 of the top 3 players...

00:50:47.456 --> 00:50:50.125
to safely pass the quota special screening?

00:50:59.436 --> 00:51:01.036
(New post)

00:51:03.906 --> 00:51:05.105
Hey, seriously!

00:51:06.675 --> 00:51:08.516
I bet you've got a new girlfriend.

00:51:26.025 --> 00:51:28.395
Way to go, right before such an important match.

00:51:29.335 --> 00:51:30.636
So who is it, this time?

00:51:32.235 --> 00:51:33.266
A pretty one.

00:51:36.136 --> 00:51:37.175
She's like me.

00:51:38.306 --> 00:51:39.346
What do you mean?

00:51:39.945 --> 00:51:41.016
You mean, you're both pretty?

00:51:42.016 --> 00:51:44.516
Or is she a taekwondo athlete too?

00:51:44.616 --> 00:51:45.715
No.

00:51:46.346 --> 00:51:47.616
She's deaf, just like me.

00:51:49.485 --> 00:51:50.826
She attends an arts high school and plays the cello.

00:52:16.145 --> 00:52:17.616
Hello, what would you like to order...

00:52:40.835 --> 00:52:42.605
(Choi Se Gyeong)

00:52:46.246 --> 00:52:50.746
Oh, wait... Just a moment, please.

00:52:54.085 --> 00:52:56.056
Gosh, seriously?

00:52:57.686 --> 00:52:58.985
What would you like to order?

00:53:23.576 --> 00:53:27.116
Come on. Let me hear your voice.

00:53:28.315 --> 00:53:30.755
Come on. Speak.

00:53:31.726 --> 00:53:34.025
Come on. Hurry up.

00:53:34.795 --> 00:53:37.694
Wait, how can she play the cello if she's deaf?

00:53:37.695 --> 00:53:39.025
I want the Watermelon Sugar flavour.

00:53:39.565 --> 00:53:40.596
What about you girls?

00:53:41.195 --> 00:53:42.235
What? It was a lie?

00:53:43.235 --> 00:53:44.936
So she isn't deaf?

00:53:46.366 --> 00:53:47.875
Why did she lie about something like that?

00:53:48.406 --> 00:53:50.706
No idea. She must've had a reason.

00:53:51.005 --> 00:53:52.906
Maybe she's like that just in front of me.

00:53:53.005 --> 00:53:55.846
Right, so why would she put on such an act in front of you?

00:53:56.346 --> 00:53:58.944
Because she likes me and wants to become like me.

00:53:58.945 --> 00:54:00.346
I guess she wants my attention?

00:54:01.715 --> 00:54:02.755
I mean, maybe?

00:54:05.355 --> 00:54:06.686
Kudos to you for being so confident.

00:54:07.656 --> 00:54:09.125
Then how do you guys communicate?

00:54:09.956 --> 00:54:11.226
You said she couldn't use sign language.

00:54:12.195 --> 00:54:13.464
We exchange notes.

00:54:13.465 --> 00:54:16.465
Her handwriting is so pretty. Just like her face.

00:54:23.005 --> 00:54:24.174
Code zero.

00:54:24.175 --> 00:54:25.945
Come to the store at once, both of you. Hurry up.

00:54:28.875 --> 00:54:30.545
Here's your ice cream!

00:54:36.715 --> 00:54:37.726
Ta-Da.

00:54:39.186 --> 00:54:41.326
Ta-Da. Surprise.

00:54:45.496 --> 00:54:46.624
Just say it,

00:54:46.625 --> 00:54:48.465
and stop making my heart pound.

00:54:49.036 --> 00:54:51.004
- That's not what I ordered.
- It is.

00:54:51.005 --> 00:54:52.464
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is.

00:54:52.465 --> 00:54:54.135
You ordered Watermelon Sugar.

00:54:54.136 --> 00:54:56.004
I added an extra scoop...

00:54:56.005 --> 00:54:58.705
and a little more to show you my love.

00:54:58.706 --> 00:54:59.906
I'm sorry,

00:55:00.175 --> 00:55:01.814
but I don't think I can carry that.

00:55:01.815 --> 00:55:03.615
Oh, I will take care of that.

00:55:03.616 --> 00:55:05.445
I'll deliver it to your table, safe and sound.

00:55:17.226 --> 00:55:19.496
Make way. Get out of my way!

00:55:23.465 --> 00:55:24.936
Arrived safely!

00:55:25.065 --> 00:55:26.735
Watermelon Sugar!

00:55:28.175 --> 00:55:29.235
Hey, Yi Chan!

00:55:31.545 --> 00:55:33.005
Code zero. Run.

00:55:33.105 --> 00:55:35.774
My gosh. How rude. Can't you see that there are customers here?

00:55:35.775 --> 00:55:37.916
- Your grandma is here, you idiot.
- What?

00:55:43.085 --> 00:55:45.525
My name is Ha Yi Chan. We'll meet again.

00:55:49.755 --> 00:55:52.226
- Hey, wait up.
- Grandma!

00:55:59.936 --> 00:56:01.575
You. Stop right there.

00:56:01.576 --> 00:56:03.675
Grandma, you put that down first.

00:56:03.835 --> 00:56:06.774
You're still wet behind the ears. Shouldn't you be studying?

00:56:06.775 --> 00:56:09.245
How could you con people to earn money?

00:56:09.246 --> 00:56:11.045
My gosh! What do you mean I conned people?

00:56:11.145 --> 00:56:12.485
How could you say such a thing to your grandson?

00:56:12.815 --> 00:56:15.854
You stole the college boys' student cards...

00:56:15.855 --> 00:56:18.155
to get a job. If that's not fraud, what is?

00:56:18.156 --> 00:56:20.655
It's not fraud. It's my part-time job!

00:56:20.656 --> 00:56:22.055
I never told you to get a part-time job.

00:56:22.056 --> 00:56:23.555
It's not like I did it for selfish reasons.

00:56:23.556 --> 00:56:24.865
I want to see you live a comfortable life, Grandma.

00:56:24.866 --> 00:56:25.894
This is all on you!

00:56:25.895 --> 00:56:27.595
The moment I catch you,

00:56:27.596 --> 00:56:30.536
I'm going to stitch your lips together.

00:56:35.936 --> 00:56:37.944
- Hey, what are you doing?
- My gosh. I'm sorry.

00:56:37.945 --> 00:56:39.846
- What a mess.
- Let me help.

00:56:59.726 --> 00:57:00.726
I'm sorry!

00:57:08.605 --> 00:57:10.406
Sorry, coming through!

00:57:15.246 --> 00:57:16.346
Well, all right.

00:57:16.416 --> 00:57:19.715
Even if you regret it later, you should get married.

00:57:20.686 --> 00:57:21.686
Stop right there, you brat!

00:57:21.687 --> 00:57:23.916
(To Die For Chicken)

00:57:31.326 --> 00:57:33.326
What happened? You called code zero.

00:57:33.525 --> 00:57:35.036
Look, over there.

00:57:35.295 --> 00:57:36.366
(To Die For Chicken)

00:57:36.395 --> 00:57:38.135
- What do you think?
- Goodness.

00:57:38.136 --> 00:57:40.464
- Oh, boy.
- Your business is doing well.

00:57:40.465 --> 00:57:42.576
(I hear Eun Gyeol gets such good grades in school.)

00:57:42.706 --> 00:57:43.805
You're doing well for yourself.

00:57:43.806 --> 00:57:46.105
We had that meeting today, so I'm sure everything will be fine.

00:57:46.906 --> 00:57:49.174
Your dad brought them here after the vendors' meeting.

00:57:49.175 --> 00:57:51.115
"Eun Gyeol is..."

00:57:51.116 --> 00:57:52.246
Why?

00:57:53.186 --> 00:57:55.185
To brag to them about how he managed to turn things around...

00:57:55.186 --> 00:57:56.556
and come back after six years.

00:57:57.616 --> 00:58:00.385
And he's been bragging about his sons for an hour now.

00:58:00.386 --> 00:58:02.226
Hey. Oh, thanks.

00:58:07.625 --> 00:58:08.936
I know you're jealous. Don't lie.

00:58:14.105 --> 00:58:16.035
Yes, you raised them well. Good job.

00:58:16.036 --> 00:58:17.674
- We give you that.
- Yes.

00:58:17.675 --> 00:58:19.044
- Oh, boy.
- Goodness.

00:58:19.045 --> 00:58:20.576
- Gosh.
- Five, four,

00:58:20.775 --> 00:58:22.275
three, two,

00:58:22.746 --> 00:58:23.916
- This is nice.
- one.

00:58:24.645 --> 00:58:25.645
- Hey, you know...
- And he's out.

00:58:27.585 --> 00:58:30.315
He conked out again. Goodness. Here he goes again.

00:58:31.656 --> 00:58:32.826
Take him home.

00:58:35.355 --> 00:58:36.395
Gosh.

00:58:44.065 --> 00:58:45.136
Take care of the rest.

00:59:08.456 --> 00:59:10.226
What is it? Do you need something?

00:59:17.936 --> 00:59:20.036
Everyone at the vendors' meeting today...

00:59:20.666 --> 00:59:22.406
was envious of me.

00:59:25.706 --> 00:59:28.516
Six years ago, they all looked down on me.

00:59:29.315 --> 00:59:31.386
But now, no one can dare to look down on me.

00:59:33.516 --> 00:59:36.656
I have a son who will go on to join the taekwondo national team.

00:59:38.826 --> 00:59:41.395
And my other son who's a top student will go on to become a doctor.

00:59:42.425 --> 00:59:45.366
I have two sons with such bright futures.

00:59:47.625 --> 00:59:49.395
I'm not a doctor yet, you know.

01:00:02.116 --> 01:00:03.246
Thank you.

01:00:03.715 --> 01:00:05.386
Eun Gyeol, if it weren't for you,

01:00:06.085 --> 01:00:08.386
people would never treat me this well.

01:00:09.786 --> 01:00:11.625
Just study hard.

01:00:11.686 --> 01:00:14.755
I'll do whatever it takes to give you all the support you need.

01:00:17.125 --> 01:00:19.195
I suppose the Almighty truly exists, after all.

01:00:20.726 --> 01:00:23.235
In exchange for my deafness,

01:00:23.465 --> 01:00:26.036
the Almighty gave me my two sons, you and Eun Ho,

01:00:47.025 --> 01:00:49.125
But now, no one can dare to look down on me.

01:00:50.355 --> 01:00:51.496
Thank you.

01:00:52.125 --> 01:00:53.895
Eun Gyeol, if it weren't for you,

01:00:54.536 --> 01:00:56.835
people would never treat me this well.

01:00:58.065 --> 01:00:59.964
Just study hard.

01:00:59.965 --> 01:01:03.105
I'll do whatever it takes to give you all the support you need.

01:01:07.775 --> 01:01:09.315
(Remember. I'm my parents' pride. I will get into med school!)

01:01:52.125 --> 01:01:54.056
Do you know what this symbol here means?

01:01:56.596 --> 01:01:59.826
People who do music all understand what this means.

01:01:59.965 --> 01:02:01.565
It's like a code word.

01:02:02.295 --> 01:02:03.536
It's called a coda.

01:02:03.996 --> 01:02:07.266
When you see a coda near the end of a song,

01:02:07.605 --> 01:02:10.936
you know you should get ready to wrap it up beautifully.

01:02:11.706 --> 01:02:13.145
It has a very nice meaning.

01:02:14.746 --> 01:02:16.215
Shall I let you in on a secret?

01:02:17.476 --> 01:02:19.786
- You're a coda too.
- Me?

01:02:19.985 --> 01:02:22.854
"CODA" refers to hearing children like you...

01:02:22.855 --> 01:02:24.416
who were born...

01:02:24.826 --> 01:02:25.956
to deaf parents.

01:02:26.355 --> 01:02:28.656
There are other kids like me?

01:02:28.826 --> 01:02:30.726
Of course, there are.

01:02:31.726 --> 01:02:33.765
You connect the world filled with sounds...

01:02:33.766 --> 01:02:35.096
with the world of silence,

01:02:35.465 --> 01:02:36.735
using your voice and hands.

01:02:37.795 --> 01:02:39.335
And at times, like you.

01:02:40.206 --> 01:02:41.206
Through music.

01:04:36.255 --> 01:04:39.056
(Special thanks to Chon Ho Jin, Kim Mi Hwa, and Heo Jung Min.)

01:05:05.516 --> 01:05:10.116
(Twinkling Watermelon)

01:05:10.255 --> 01:05:12.255
I want to do music.

01:05:12.485 --> 01:05:14.124
I know you won't like this, Dad.

01:05:14.125 --> 01:05:15.595
But this is the real me.

01:05:15.596 --> 01:05:17.254
You're just lost and confused at the moment.

01:05:17.255 --> 01:05:18.795
This isn't the real you.

01:05:18.866 --> 01:05:20.195
Hello, welcome.

01:05:20.425 --> 01:05:21.464
How may I help you?

01:05:21.465 --> 01:05:23.536
Oh, are you here to sell your guitar?

01:05:24.195 --> 01:05:25.435
You're in love.

01:05:25.436 --> 01:05:26.865
The only way you can charm a pretty girl...

01:05:26.866 --> 01:05:29.035
when you have no money or power...

01:05:29.036 --> 01:05:30.605
is to join a band!

01:05:30.875 --> 01:05:32.306
What did you just say?

01:05:32.476 --> 01:05:33.504
You'll become what?

01:05:33.505 --> 01:05:34.575
Choi Se Gyeong's boyfriend.

01:05:34.576 --> 01:05:36.315
- Your fly is open.
- My gosh.

01:05:36.945 --> 01:05:37.976
Yoon Dong Jin?

01:05:38.985 --> 01:05:40.045
Dad?
