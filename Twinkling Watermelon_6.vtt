00:00:54.243 --> 00:00:55.841
What does this mean?

00:00:55.842 --> 00:00:58.641
"The King's royal advisors who bring chaos to the nation."

00:00:58.642 --> 00:00:59.782
And these two characters here mean...

00:00:59.882 --> 00:01:02.152
"Jerks who would stab their own parents."

00:01:02.153 --> 00:01:04.753
You get the idea, right?

00:01:05.782 --> 00:01:06.851
Hi.

00:01:06.852 --> 00:01:09.022
I wonder if you'd know who I am.

00:01:10.022 --> 00:01:13.123
I'm not sure if you'll actually end up getting this letter,

00:01:13.592 --> 00:01:15.193
but I'm going to keep writing it anyway.

00:01:18.003 --> 00:01:19.461
Where should I even begin?

00:01:19.462 --> 00:01:20.803
Even after saying they'd never do it again,

00:01:21.232 --> 00:01:23.803
they'd leave their stuff at some pool hall and...

00:01:34.783 --> 00:01:37.283
The world where I live in is devoid of sound.

00:01:38.753 --> 00:01:40.582
So when I close my eyes like this,

00:01:40.583 --> 00:01:41.822
the whole world disappears.

00:01:43.352 --> 00:01:47.223
But in its place, a vivid old memory is brought up.

00:01:49.063 --> 00:01:50.393
A memory of someone...

00:01:50.732 --> 00:01:53.132
who used to call my name with her hand instead of her voice.

00:01:54.303 --> 00:01:56.902
Chung Ah.

00:02:02.673 --> 00:02:03.712
A clear...

00:02:08.083 --> 00:02:09.083
sound.

00:02:31.542 --> 00:02:32.602
Mom.

00:02:42.552 --> 00:02:43.612
I like you.

00:02:49.693 --> 00:02:50.822
I love you.

00:02:51.663 --> 00:02:53.623
Back then, I had a name,

00:02:53.862 --> 00:02:55.163
and I could smile.

00:02:56.193 --> 00:02:57.262
But...

00:03:03.503 --> 00:03:06.743
Chung Ah...

00:03:13.042 --> 00:03:15.783
(Mom, I like you.)

00:03:16.153 --> 00:03:18.622
(Mom, I love you.)

00:03:18.623 --> 00:03:20.683
Chung Ah!

00:04:10.873 --> 00:04:12.273
You must be Chung Ah.

00:04:15.012 --> 00:04:18.882
I'm your live-in tutor who will teach you starting today.

00:04:20.783 --> 00:04:22.412
That darned witch.

00:04:22.413 --> 00:04:24.182
She came to ruin my life.

00:04:24.183 --> 00:04:25.223
Say "Pa."

00:04:27.683 --> 00:04:28.723
Pa!

00:04:55.883 --> 00:04:56.883
Pa!

00:05:49.033 --> 00:05:51.442
At the time, all that I had left was my burning anger,

00:05:58.643 --> 00:06:02.413
because I had no other way of expressing myself and my feelings.

00:06:15.533 --> 00:06:17.362
- Try this. - Is it good?

00:06:20.203 --> 00:06:22.272
Yes, it's good.

00:06:22.273 --> 00:06:24.642
- Yes. - Oh, my. How have you been?

00:06:24.643 --> 00:06:26.073
- Hello! - Hello.

00:06:26.643 --> 00:06:29.573
Move! Out of my way!

00:06:43.052 --> 00:06:45.292
- What's with him? - Oh, no.

00:06:47.622 --> 00:06:49.932
- Hey, you! - Gosh, I'm sorry!

00:06:57.273 --> 00:06:59.073
What's your deal? Hey!

00:06:59.903 --> 00:07:01.442
- How dare you! - Gosh.

00:07:02.573 --> 00:07:03.872
Stop right there!

00:07:05.643 --> 00:07:08.311
On the day I first saw you,

00:07:08.312 --> 00:07:10.252
I got to laugh heartily for the first time in a long while.

00:07:34.343 --> 00:07:36.242
The second time I saw you,

00:07:36.713 --> 00:07:40.013
I felt the sound of my heartbeat for the first time ever.

00:07:40.112 --> 00:07:42.912
This is on the house.

00:07:42.913 --> 00:07:44.952
- My gosh. Thank you. - Thank you.

00:07:44.953 --> 00:07:46.152
- Three vanillas, right? - Even your heart is handsome.

00:07:46.153 --> 00:07:48.621
From the third time onward, I went to see you.

00:07:48.622 --> 00:07:50.552
- For real? - Even your heart is handsome.

00:07:50.953 --> 00:07:52.291
Thank you, my heart is beautiful as well.

00:07:52.292 --> 00:07:53.893
Although you probably had no idea.

00:07:54.463 --> 00:07:56.093
Have a nice day!

00:08:13.383 --> 00:08:14.482
Actually,

00:08:16.013 --> 00:08:17.013
I'm in a band too.

00:08:17.014 --> 00:08:19.082
- What's this? - What's he doing?

00:08:19.083 --> 00:08:20.223
- What's going on? - My goodness.

00:08:20.482 --> 00:08:21.492
Se Gyeong.

00:08:22.093 --> 00:08:24.422
Do you want to come to our concert later?

00:08:24.763 --> 00:08:28.092
If I hadn't let Se Gyeong borrow that T-shirt...

00:08:28.093 --> 00:08:29.763
My school is having a festival a month later.

00:08:30.062 --> 00:08:32.002
I will prepare a performance, just for you.

00:08:32.203 --> 00:08:33.203
Please come to watch me.

00:08:33.204 --> 00:08:36.333
Then would I have been the one standing before you?

00:08:39.203 --> 00:08:40.643
I closed my eyes again...

00:08:41.302 --> 00:08:43.242
because I wanted the world to disappear.

00:09:13.403 --> 00:09:14.472
But...

00:09:17.243 --> 00:09:18.542
Interestingly enough,

00:09:18.613 --> 00:09:21.552
you always showed up whenever I was locked up.

00:09:25.753 --> 00:09:27.283
Sorry I bit your hand.

00:09:30.853 --> 00:09:32.322
And I'm sorry for being so feisty.

00:09:38.033 --> 00:09:39.633
If you need my help, let me know.

00:09:40.462 --> 00:09:42.702
Well, I'll be off then.

00:09:57.253 --> 00:09:58.882

00:09:58.883 --> 00:10:00.552
(Contact us to join the band, First Love Memory Manipulators.)

00:10:01.353 --> 00:10:03.253
I didn't react like that because I disliked you.

00:10:03.952 --> 00:10:05.062
The truth is...

00:10:11.633 --> 00:10:13.503
I wanted to thank you.

00:10:18.942 --> 00:10:23.243
I wanted to thank you for helping me and finding me.

00:10:23.743 --> 00:10:25.383
That's why I went to see you.

00:10:25.812 --> 00:10:28.082
To show you how I really felt.

00:10:28.253 --> 00:10:29.253
But...

00:10:31.283 --> 00:10:34.123
(Bestin Rabbit Thirty Seven Ice Cream)

00:10:39.422 --> 00:10:40.493
Hey, Se Gyeong.

00:10:40.562 --> 00:10:43.192
Hi. It's been a while, Yi Chan.

00:10:46.163 --> 00:10:47.202
But...

00:10:49.003 --> 00:10:50.332
it looks like...

00:10:51.273 --> 00:10:52.503
I was late once again.

00:11:10.192 --> 00:11:12.393
(Bestin Rabbit Thirty Seven Ice Cream)

00:11:12.422 --> 00:11:15.562
Se Gyeong, wait here. I'll be right back, okay?

00:11:23.233 --> 00:11:24.332
What's your deal?

00:11:24.802 --> 00:11:28.172
Oh, I don't understand what you're asking with such a vague question.

00:11:31.582 --> 00:11:32.883
You said you came back to die...

00:11:34.082 --> 00:11:36.153
and that you were still debating whether or not to end your life.

00:11:36.552 --> 00:11:38.921
You menacingly threatened me not to tell anyone that I saw you...

00:11:38.922 --> 00:11:41.123
unless I wanted to die, and then you disappeared.

00:11:41.483 --> 00:11:44.052
So why did you voluntarily show up here?

00:11:44.222 --> 00:11:45.922
My goodness.

00:11:46.192 --> 00:11:48.062
So it was actually such a deep question?

00:11:48.163 --> 00:11:50.992
No wonder why. My reading comprehension isn't bad.

00:11:50.993 --> 00:11:52.562
Stop changing the subject, and answer my question!

00:11:56.702 --> 00:11:57.832
I'm here because of you.

00:11:59.103 --> 00:12:00.142
What?

00:12:00.143 --> 00:12:02.513
Don't act like you didn't hear me. You heard what I said.

00:12:03.113 --> 00:12:04.472
I said it was because of you.

00:12:15.023 --> 00:12:16.853
Wait. Hey!

00:12:18.562 --> 00:12:19.592
Wait.

00:12:19.863 --> 00:12:21.023
Right, she can't hear.

00:12:32.373 --> 00:12:33.403
That wasn't me.

00:12:33.842 --> 00:12:34.903
I just...

00:12:38.042 --> 00:12:39.143
Wait.

00:13:07.472 --> 00:13:08.743
Because of me?

00:13:09.342 --> 00:13:10.413
What does that mean?

00:13:10.513 --> 00:13:12.842
Oh, it's not raining anymore.

00:13:13.613 --> 00:13:15.782
Answer me! I asked you what you meant by it!

00:13:15.783 --> 00:13:18.283
That startled me. Why are you yelling?

00:13:18.422 --> 00:13:21.483
You said I wasn't supposed to come back.

00:13:21.552 --> 00:13:24.451
I was curious what would happen if I didn't listen to you.

00:13:24.452 --> 00:13:25.493
Is that a good enough answer?

00:13:26.393 --> 00:13:27.993
Is Yi Chan a complete joke to you?

00:13:29.633 --> 00:13:31.702
Now you're just provoking me.

00:13:32.163 --> 00:13:33.662
Did I ever say I thought he was a joke?

00:13:33.663 --> 00:13:34.902
I'm just curious.

00:13:34.903 --> 00:13:37.733
You're toying with his feelings just for the sake of your curiosity.

00:13:38.503 --> 00:13:40.202
You still want to play around even though you wanted to die?

00:13:40.672 --> 00:13:41.873
Why? Am I not allowed to play?

00:13:42.672 --> 00:13:44.211
- What? - Or are you telling me...

00:13:44.212 --> 00:13:45.912
to hurry up and decide whether or not to die?

00:13:45.913 --> 00:13:47.913
- That's not what I meant. - If not that,

00:13:48.283 --> 00:13:50.952
are you saying I should just keep my mouth shut and die?

00:13:53.023 --> 00:13:56.422
Don't worry, I will disappear when the time comes.

00:13:58.462 --> 00:13:59.493
You...

00:14:00.222 --> 00:14:01.792
Are you really the Choi Se Gyeong I know?

00:14:02.033 --> 00:14:04.993
Se Gyeong! Choi Se Gyeong!

00:14:06.003 --> 00:14:07.903
I am Choi Se Gyeong, according to him.

00:14:11.033 --> 00:14:13.071
Sorry for keeping you waiting.

00:14:13.072 --> 00:14:14.242
Don't worry about it.

00:14:14.243 --> 00:14:16.143
It's on me for showing up without notice.

00:14:16.913 --> 00:14:20.383
Yi Chan, can we talk for a moment?

00:14:21.113 --> 00:14:24.783
Then give me a second. Let me go in and tell my manager.

00:14:27.082 --> 00:14:28.082
Sir!

00:14:29.552 --> 00:14:30.623
Aren't you leaving?

00:14:31.592 --> 00:14:34.222
Don't tell me you're tagging along just to third wheel like a loser.

00:14:45.842 --> 00:14:48.542
I heard you went to study abroad. So how are you...

00:14:54.582 --> 00:14:56.753
Why are you staring at me like that?

00:14:56.983 --> 00:14:59.283
So this is what you looked like, Yi Chan.

00:14:59.523 --> 00:15:00.523
What?

00:15:00.682 --> 00:15:02.493
You're much more handsome than I thought.

00:15:05.393 --> 00:15:06.921
Did you come back to make fun of me?

00:15:06.922 --> 00:15:08.493
No, of course not.

00:15:08.763 --> 00:15:10.033
Do you know how much I paid for my flight?

00:15:12.633 --> 00:15:14.103
I'm back because something came up.

00:15:14.263 --> 00:15:15.332
What happened?

00:15:15.873 --> 00:15:17.572
No one else seems to know that you're back.

00:15:17.702 --> 00:15:20.072
Of course, no one knows. I arrived yesterday.

00:15:20.603 --> 00:15:23.342
At the moment, you're the only one who knows that I'm back.

00:15:26.983 --> 00:15:28.983
Well, are you back for good?

00:15:30.853 --> 00:15:32.952
I'm not sure. I've still yet to decide on that.

00:15:34.383 --> 00:15:36.092
Then why did you come to see me?

00:15:36.592 --> 00:15:38.052
You left without a word.

00:15:40.292 --> 00:15:41.523
I came to apologize.

00:15:43.692 --> 00:15:46.202
I've been rude to you, and I feel bad about it.

00:15:47.233 --> 00:15:49.301
Sorry, I flat out belittled you...

00:15:49.302 --> 00:15:52.103
when I barely knew you. I want to apologize for that.

00:15:52.972 --> 00:15:54.042
And...

00:15:55.072 --> 00:15:57.442
I want to get to know you better.

00:15:57.672 --> 00:16:00.542
Of course, our bet's still on.

00:16:06.523 --> 00:16:08.353
Gosh, why isn't he back yet?

00:16:13.993 --> 00:16:15.692
What did she say? Why is she back?

00:16:16.292 --> 00:16:18.462
Why on earth did she come to see you?

00:16:18.832 --> 00:16:19.832
Hey.

00:16:21.562 --> 00:16:22.733
Have you ever been in a relationship?

00:16:23.233 --> 00:16:24.633
- A relationship? - Yes.

00:16:25.373 --> 00:16:27.072
Well...

00:16:28.202 --> 00:16:29.273
Of course, I...

00:16:30.913 --> 00:16:33.042
Forget it. I already know what your answer will be.

00:16:33.913 --> 00:16:35.582
Your eyes were quivering just now.

00:16:39.653 --> 00:16:40.983
You poor sap.

00:16:41.552 --> 00:16:43.123
You're a fool who doesn't even know what love is.

00:16:44.493 --> 00:16:46.763
Could someone like you, who has never dated,

00:16:47.562 --> 00:16:50.562
understand the delicate conversation I had with Se Gyeong?

00:16:51.133 --> 00:16:52.331
What Se Gyeong told me was...

00:16:52.332 --> 00:16:54.932
Forget it. I'm not curious at all.

00:16:55.432 --> 00:16:56.672
Don't say another word.

00:16:57.133 --> 00:16:59.441
Hey, kiddo. Ask me again politely.

00:16:59.442 --> 00:17:01.242
You never know, I might tell you.

00:17:01.243 --> 00:17:03.773
Come on, I know you want to hear all about it.

00:17:14.783 --> 00:17:15.993
I'm not curious.

00:17:16.552 --> 00:17:17.722
I am not curious at all.

00:17:19.522 --> 00:17:22.262
- Oh, my! - I'm telling you!

00:17:23.333 --> 00:17:25.192
- Ha Yi Chan! - Ha Yi Chan!

00:17:25.663 --> 00:17:27.931
Se Gyeong, who cut her hair short,

00:17:27.932 --> 00:17:30.932
was standing right before my eyes.

00:17:31.373 --> 00:17:33.971
When I saw her, my heart skipped a beat.

00:17:33.972 --> 00:17:36.073
- Come on. - Seriously, for real.

00:17:36.813 --> 00:17:39.242
What can I do besides fall for her again?

00:17:39.343 --> 00:17:42.083
Hey, who did you say she looked like?

00:17:42.413 --> 00:17:44.583
- Lee Young Ae? - In the past, yes.

00:17:44.982 --> 00:17:46.153
Now, she looks like Ko So Young.

00:17:46.752 --> 00:17:50.293
If she used to charge me little by little like an electrolyte drink,

00:17:50.722 --> 00:17:52.363
now she's like... How should I put this?

00:17:53.422 --> 00:17:56.393
She's like a fizzy, carbonated drink that's intoxicatingly refreshing.

00:17:57.363 --> 00:17:59.603
That's quite an analogy!

00:18:01.032 --> 00:18:02.472
Guys, lean in closer.

00:18:03.002 --> 00:18:05.902
What can I do to make Se Gyeong totally mine?

00:18:05.903 --> 00:18:08.672
Hey, she's already all yours.

00:18:08.942 --> 00:18:10.813
- Really? - Listen up.

00:18:12.083 --> 00:18:13.813
Women's hairs...

00:18:14.543 --> 00:18:15.883
have blood vessels running through them.

00:18:16.413 --> 00:18:17.752
Blood flows through them.

00:18:18.383 --> 00:18:20.682
You said she cut her hair short.

00:18:20.883 --> 00:18:22.793
That's like cutting her own veins.

00:18:23.323 --> 00:18:25.792
She's crying tears of blood!

00:18:25.793 --> 00:18:27.662
Why is that?

00:18:27.663 --> 00:18:29.662
What do you think? It's because of you!

00:18:29.663 --> 00:18:30.793
My gosh.

00:18:31.333 --> 00:18:33.802
Oh, my! Because of me?

00:18:33.803 --> 00:18:36.001
- Hey, you said she came to see you. - Yes.

00:18:36.002 --> 00:18:38.772
And she apologized for being rude to you.

00:18:39.343 --> 00:18:41.402
She even said, "I want to get to know you better,"

00:18:41.403 --> 00:18:43.372
"and our bet's still on."

00:18:43.373 --> 00:18:44.471
What do you think all this means?

00:18:44.472 --> 00:18:46.712
Well, what does it mean?

00:18:47.782 --> 00:18:49.712
After she left, she realized how much she cared for you...

00:18:50.782 --> 00:18:52.582
and regretted letting you go!

00:18:52.583 --> 00:18:54.752
All the while, she was crying tears of blood.

00:18:54.883 --> 00:18:57.022
On top of that, she suddenly thinks you're handsome.

00:18:57.252 --> 00:19:00.322
- She's head over heels for you! - That's right, it's game over.

00:19:00.323 --> 00:19:01.462
Game over!

00:19:03.663 --> 00:19:04.732
Guys, what should I do?

00:19:05.502 --> 00:19:07.432
Even I can't handle my own charms.

00:19:09.833 --> 00:19:11.332
- Goodness. - Hey!

00:19:11.333 --> 00:19:12.941
- Se Gyeong! - Ha Yi Chan!

00:19:12.942 --> 00:19:14.543
- Ha Yi Chan! - Se Gyeong!

00:19:21.913 --> 00:19:25.583
It's like lyrics out of a trot song. Is that really what she's thinking?

00:19:36.133 --> 00:19:37.592
I mean, that Choi Se Gyeong?

00:19:37.593 --> 00:19:40.802
Open it. He left it behind for you.

00:19:40.803 --> 00:19:42.272
That's how I remember her.

00:19:43.672 --> 00:19:45.442
Are they really the same person?

00:19:46.202 --> 00:19:47.772
What is she really thinking?

00:19:48.043 --> 00:19:49.212
I came back to die.

00:19:49.913 --> 00:19:50.972
To die.

00:19:51.712 --> 00:19:52.813
To put an end to all of it.

00:19:53.643 --> 00:19:54.782
Don't worry.

00:19:55.012 --> 00:19:57.053
I will disappear when the time comes.

00:19:58.053 --> 00:19:59.053
No way.

00:20:00.482 --> 00:20:02.323
She can't actually be planning to take her own life, right?

00:20:12.903 --> 00:20:13.903
Hey!

00:20:14.732 --> 00:20:15.903
What are you doing here?

00:20:18.103 --> 00:20:19.972
How did you get my address?

00:20:22.272 --> 00:20:24.373
Yi Chan and I came here to see you once.

00:20:24.972 --> 00:20:26.083
Don't you remember?

00:20:28.482 --> 00:20:30.012
You did?

00:20:31.383 --> 00:20:32.922
You must care even less about Yi Chan...

00:20:33.482 --> 00:20:35.452
than the dirt under your toenails.

00:20:35.853 --> 00:20:38.252
Whatever. Why are you here?

00:20:41.593 --> 00:20:43.961
Forget it. It doesn't look like you'll starve to death for a while.

00:20:43.962 --> 00:20:45.063
What's this?

00:20:45.702 --> 00:20:48.133
Did you come all the way here because you were worried about me?

00:20:49.172 --> 00:20:51.833
I didn't know you were such an angel.

00:21:00.383 --> 00:21:01.442
Hey, you.

00:21:01.643 --> 00:21:02.852
If you make a hobby of threatening others,

00:21:02.853 --> 00:21:04.512
you'll end up becoming a swindler.

00:21:05.452 --> 00:21:07.553
You sure have a knack for it, so you should be careful.

00:21:09.053 --> 00:21:10.992
It looks like you have quite the talent for it too.

00:21:11.222 --> 00:21:12.262
Really?

00:21:15.593 --> 00:21:16.893
Then shall I flaunt my skills a little?

00:21:18.633 --> 00:21:20.803
You'd better not show up in front of Yi Chan again.

00:21:22.002 --> 00:21:23.032
This is your final warning.

00:21:31.242 --> 00:21:32.242
That little...

00:21:55.202 --> 00:21:57.333
(Baekwang High School)

00:21:59.843 --> 00:22:01.741
Hey, where are you going?

00:22:01.742 --> 00:22:03.441
Sorry, let me borrow this for a bit!

00:22:03.442 --> 00:22:04.442
Has he lost his mind?

00:22:04.443 --> 00:22:06.413
Hey, that's my skateboard!

00:22:13.123 --> 00:22:14.982
Move! Make way!

00:22:34.403 --> 00:22:39.012
(First Love Memory Manipulators)

00:22:41.782 --> 00:22:42.952
(First Love Memory Manipulators)

00:23:07.843 --> 00:23:09.012
Welcome, our front man!

00:23:09.742 --> 00:23:10.873
We were waiting for you.

00:23:11.573 --> 00:23:13.642
This is our first practice session. Are you ready to have some fun?

00:23:13.643 --> 00:23:15.083
Are you ready to set the stage on fire?

00:23:15.212 --> 00:23:17.052
Everybody, make some noise!

00:23:17.053 --> 00:23:19.922
- We're ready! - We're ready!

00:23:21.553 --> 00:23:23.022
Come on, brothers!

00:23:30.932 --> 00:23:32.063
You must be out of your mind.

00:23:32.303 --> 00:23:33.531
How could you be late to our first practice session?

00:23:33.532 --> 00:23:34.931
Don't tell me you skateboarded here.

00:23:34.932 --> 00:23:37.302
If you're late again, I'll knock all your front teeth out.

00:23:37.303 --> 00:23:38.731
What if you got hurt skateboarding?

00:23:38.732 --> 00:23:39.941
Being late is better than getting hurt!

00:23:39.942 --> 00:23:41.441
I clearly warned you...

00:23:41.442 --> 00:23:42.711
to pour your heart and soul into this...

00:23:42.712 --> 00:23:44.112
if you want to keep the front man title.

00:23:44.113 --> 00:23:46.842
I told you to be careful at all times until the end of the year.

00:23:46.843 --> 00:23:49.052
Could you two at least arrive at an agreement...

00:23:49.053 --> 00:23:50.451
before lashing out at me?

00:23:50.452 --> 00:23:52.823
All right, guys. There's no time for chitchat.

00:23:52.952 --> 00:23:55.082
This is our set list, so check through it.

00:23:55.083 --> 00:23:56.921
There are four songs in total, including the encore performance.

00:23:56.922 --> 00:23:59.063
We all voted together for this. So there are no objections, right?

00:23:59.992 --> 00:24:01.592
Great, the set list has been finalized.

00:24:01.593 --> 00:24:03.932
We've hired a designer to design our official T-shirt.

00:24:04.262 --> 00:24:05.563
All right, then.

00:24:05.833 --> 00:24:08.333
Shall we begin our first practice session?

00:24:09.232 --> 00:24:11.073
- Front man. - Why, manager?

00:24:17.972 --> 00:24:19.712
Why are you standing there? Aren't you going to practice?

00:24:43.472 --> 00:24:47.843
All right, let us now begin First Love Memory Manipulators'...

00:24:49.143 --> 00:24:50.343
first practice session.

00:24:53.242 --> 00:24:58.153
One, two, one, two, three, four.

00:25:15.603 --> 00:25:19.602
Who are you looking at?

00:25:19.603 --> 00:25:24.241
I'm standing right before your eyes

00:25:24.242 --> 00:25:28.211
Don't make me wait too long

00:25:28.212 --> 00:25:32.313
- Don't think that I'd be smiling - Eun Gyeol, add a double!

00:25:32.583 --> 00:25:36.422
- I don't expect a lot from you - I don't expect a lot from you

00:25:36.823 --> 00:25:41.191
- I just need a loving gaze - I just need a loving gaze

00:25:41.192 --> 00:25:45.531
- I want to tell you how I feel - I want to tell you how I feel

00:25:45.532 --> 00:25:52.702
- But your eyes say something else - But your eyes say something else

00:25:54.672 --> 00:25:58.613
- I thought we knew each other well - I thought we knew each other well

00:25:59.012 --> 00:26:03.113
- That's why I thought it was love - That's why I thought it was love

00:26:03.353 --> 00:26:07.252
- Don't go too far - Don't go too far

00:26:07.623 --> 00:26:12.792
- Someday, you will tell me - Someday, you will tell me

00:26:12.793 --> 00:26:16.462
- That you love me - That you love me

00:26:21.262 --> 00:26:22.702
We did pretty well today, don't you think?

00:26:22.873 --> 00:26:23.873
Yes.

00:26:23.874 --> 00:26:25.672
It wasn't bad, considering it was our first practice session.

00:26:26.502 --> 00:26:29.312
For the other songs, we just need to practice hard.

00:26:29.313 --> 00:26:30.972
The final song is the problem.

00:26:31.573 --> 00:26:32.643
The final song? What about it?

00:26:33.212 --> 00:26:35.343
It's not an easy song to master in such a short period of time.

00:26:36.012 --> 00:26:37.052
It's all someone's fault.

00:26:37.053 --> 00:26:39.352
Hey, if I work myself to the bone...

00:26:39.353 --> 00:26:40.482
Then we'll be meeting at your funeral.

00:26:40.883 --> 00:26:42.792
We really can't pull it off.

00:26:42.793 --> 00:26:44.653
- We should change it soon... - No!

00:26:45.752 --> 00:26:47.663
Se Gyeong chose the song.

00:26:47.823 --> 00:26:49.062
We absolutely can't change it.

00:26:49.063 --> 00:26:50.431
You're an idiot.

00:26:50.432 --> 00:26:52.663
She wants to humiliate you, but you have no idea.

00:26:53.032 --> 00:26:54.133
What do you mean?

00:26:54.262 --> 00:26:56.201
Why do you think she chose that song?

00:26:56.202 --> 00:26:58.002
She likes Kurt Cobain. That's why!

00:26:58.133 --> 00:26:59.941
She wants to hear me singing the song!

00:26:59.942 --> 00:27:01.272
You're being ridiculous.

00:27:01.643 --> 00:27:03.412
She picked such a difficult song on purpose...

00:27:03.413 --> 00:27:04.671
to mess with you.

00:27:04.672 --> 00:27:05.741
To make you give up.

00:27:05.742 --> 00:27:08.312
Or to humiliate you on stage if you refuse to give up!

00:27:08.313 --> 00:27:09.781
Se Gyeong would never do that.

00:27:09.782 --> 00:27:11.312
Hey, calm down.

00:27:11.313 --> 00:27:13.582
Honestly, you're so delusional.

00:27:13.583 --> 00:27:15.623
Hey, you're the only one who doesn't know that.

00:27:15.752 --> 00:27:18.421
Everyone else in this whole area knows the truth.

00:27:18.422 --> 00:27:19.722
That's enough, okay?

00:27:19.962 --> 00:27:21.822
Our front man doesn't want to change the song.

00:27:21.823 --> 00:27:23.432
He says he will do his best.

00:27:23.492 --> 00:27:25.232
Can't you just trust him and let him do it?

00:27:25.532 --> 00:27:27.231
- Goodness. - Okay, fine.

00:27:27.232 --> 00:27:28.603
We'll go for it even if we can't pull it off!

00:27:29.202 --> 00:27:30.772
Hey, what's going on over there?

00:27:30.873 --> 00:27:32.133
What's with all the fuss?

00:27:32.643 --> 00:27:34.672
- Take off the helmet. - Take it off.

00:27:37.712 --> 00:27:40.412
- Hey, who is she? - Take off your helmet.

00:27:40.413 --> 00:27:42.211
- My gosh. - Are you here to see someone?

00:27:42.212 --> 00:27:44.211
- Take off your helmet. - Take it off.

00:27:44.212 --> 00:27:45.412
- Show us your face. - Show us.

00:27:45.413 --> 00:27:47.653
- No way. That can't be her. - Who is she?

00:27:48.353 --> 00:27:50.721
- Take off your helmet. - Take it off.

00:27:50.722 --> 00:27:53.062
- Are you here to meet someone? - Take off your helmet.

00:27:53.063 --> 00:27:54.392
No way.

00:27:54.393 --> 00:27:55.962
I sternly warned her.

00:27:56.133 --> 00:27:57.793
- Take off your helmet. - Let us see your face.

00:27:58.932 --> 00:28:01.962
- My gosh. - It's Choi Se Gyeong!

00:28:04.232 --> 00:28:05.432
The warning didn't work at all.

00:28:05.633 --> 00:28:07.043
My gosh. Why is she here?

00:28:07.803 --> 00:28:10.711
- Oh, my. - Look, it's Choi Se Gyeong!

00:28:10.712 --> 00:28:12.313
Yi Chan, hi!

00:28:20.752 --> 00:28:22.951
Se Gyeong, what brings you to this humble place?

00:28:22.952 --> 00:28:24.622
I went to the ice cream shop and was told...

00:28:24.623 --> 00:28:25.892
that you had a practice session today.

00:28:25.893 --> 00:28:27.663
So I'm here to show you my support.

00:28:28.593 --> 00:28:29.793
Guess what I have.

00:28:30.432 --> 00:28:31.992
Ta-da! How about we go to the amusement park?

00:28:35.432 --> 00:28:37.431
Hey, you really didn't have to do this.

00:28:37.432 --> 00:28:38.671
I want to tag along too.

00:28:38.672 --> 00:28:40.972
I bought tickets for you guys too. Do you want to join us?

00:28:41.002 --> 00:28:42.471
- Yes. - Yes.

00:28:42.472 --> 00:28:43.512
No, I'm good.

00:28:43.813 --> 00:28:46.282
Okay. I assumed you'd say that, so I didn't buy your ticket.

00:28:46.313 --> 00:28:47.313
Yes, go home.

00:28:47.314 --> 00:28:48.712
You've been looking exhausted all day.

00:28:49.553 --> 00:28:51.353
Fine, I'm going home.

00:28:53.123 --> 00:28:54.721
I'm a pro when it comes to the pirate ship ride.

00:28:54.722 --> 00:28:56.952
I can ride it standing up and can even do a forward roll.

00:28:57.053 --> 00:28:58.852
Shall I show you a backflip too?

00:28:58.853 --> 00:29:00.562
- Really? Yes, show me later. - Show her what?

00:29:00.563 --> 00:29:02.662
I can lift the front wheel while riding the scooter.

00:29:02.663 --> 00:29:04.092
- Do you want to see it? - Lift what?

00:29:04.093 --> 00:29:06.163
- Let's go. - No!

00:29:11.502 --> 00:29:13.442
My gosh. This is really fun.

00:29:22.182 --> 00:29:23.413
Have you lost your mind?

00:29:29.222 --> 00:29:30.852
- I'm coming at you! - Bring it on!

00:29:30.853 --> 00:29:33.123
- Okay! - Let's go!

00:29:35.563 --> 00:29:37.231
Hey, what was that? What are you doing?

00:29:37.232 --> 00:29:40.032
Move! You're blocking my way.

00:29:48.242 --> 00:29:49.343
Se Gyeong, are you ready?

00:29:49.712 --> 00:29:51.672
My gosh! You scared me.

00:29:51.843 --> 00:29:53.112
- Sit back down. - Let go.

00:29:53.113 --> 00:29:54.711
Se Gyeong, help me!

00:29:54.712 --> 00:29:56.882
- Hey! - Hey, stop.

00:29:56.883 --> 00:29:58.313
- Yi Chan! - Stay seated, will you?

00:29:59.583 --> 00:30:00.981
- That little... - Let's go.

00:30:00.982 --> 00:30:02.792
- Let's go. - Hurry.

00:30:02.793 --> 00:30:04.623
- We're ready! - Let's go!

00:30:23.143 --> 00:30:24.242
Watch.

00:30:26.043 --> 00:30:28.382
- My gosh! - Oh, my!

00:30:28.383 --> 00:30:29.413
Thank you.

00:30:30.083 --> 00:30:31.313
Look at this balloon!

00:30:31.883 --> 00:30:33.352
My gosh! Look at this.

00:30:33.353 --> 00:30:35.052
Thank you. Woof!

00:30:35.053 --> 00:30:36.721
One, two.

00:30:36.722 --> 00:30:37.823
Wait!

00:30:38.053 --> 00:30:39.823
- I want to stand next to Yi Chan. - My gosh.

00:30:40.262 --> 00:30:41.323
Come here, Se Gyeong.

00:30:42.293 --> 00:30:44.893
- One, two, three. - Gosh.

00:30:48.303 --> 00:30:50.002
Follow me!

00:30:50.472 --> 00:30:51.532
- I'm good. - Oh, my.

00:30:53.043 --> 00:30:54.442
Se Gyeong, do you need anything else?

00:30:54.873 --> 00:30:55.941
Do you want something else to drink?

00:30:55.942 --> 00:30:56.971
More chicken skewers? Butter-roasted?

00:30:56.972 --> 00:30:58.942
No, I'm good. This is enough food for me.

00:30:59.143 --> 00:31:01.981
By the way, where did the napkin go? It was right here.

00:31:01.982 --> 00:31:03.153
I have to wipe this off.

00:31:03.712 --> 00:31:04.812
- You need a napkin? - Yes.

00:31:04.813 --> 00:31:06.752
Se Gyeong, I'll go get you a new one. One moment.

00:31:07.482 --> 00:31:08.522
Give me 13 seconds.

00:31:08.922 --> 00:31:11.092
He's cute. Hey, you have exactly 13 seconds.

00:31:11.093 --> 00:31:14.222
Thirteen, twelve, eleven...

00:31:18.532 --> 00:31:20.102
- Let go. - You let go.

00:31:20.103 --> 00:31:21.702
No, you let go.

00:31:22.563 --> 00:31:23.573
Fine, it's all yours.

00:31:31.043 --> 00:31:32.073
- Oh! - Gosh.

00:31:32.782 --> 00:31:35.883
Goodness. I'm so sorry.

00:31:36.282 --> 00:31:38.212
Wait just 13 seconds. He'll bring you a napkin shortly.

00:31:38.982 --> 00:31:40.022
You little...

00:31:47.722 --> 00:31:49.163
It was intentional, for sure.

00:31:49.663 --> 00:31:51.133
There was plenty of ketchup in the bottle.

00:31:51.692 --> 00:31:53.432
She didn't have to squeeze it so hard.

00:31:54.232 --> 00:31:56.573
I should've known she was up to something when she gave up.

00:31:57.633 --> 00:31:58.803
Darn it.

00:32:04.373 --> 00:32:05.442
What's your deal?

00:32:06.813 --> 00:32:07.942
Well...

00:32:08.012 --> 00:32:11.153
I don't understand what you're asking with such a vague question.

00:32:12.212 --> 00:32:13.782
You're good at applying things to different situations.

00:32:14.222 --> 00:32:17.792
Well, why are you so overprotective of Yi Chan?

00:32:17.793 --> 00:32:20.622
Why would you ruin his friendship which is perfectly healthy?

00:32:20.623 --> 00:32:21.761
You seem very passionate about it.

00:32:21.762 --> 00:32:23.991
I don't want him to get into an unhealthy relationship with a girl.

00:32:23.992 --> 00:32:25.692
I'm trying to guide him to the right path.

00:32:26.303 --> 00:32:27.402
Who do you think you are?

00:32:27.403 --> 00:32:30.103
Me? I'm Yi Chan's tutor.

00:32:30.272 --> 00:32:32.803
I must make sure Yi Chan gets into college.

00:32:33.303 --> 00:32:35.872
I'll get rid of everything that could distract him from his studies.

00:32:35.873 --> 00:32:37.073
That includes you.

00:32:37.843 --> 00:32:39.613
Many people must've told you that you're too nosy.

00:32:40.313 --> 00:32:42.383
People mostly say that I'm responsible.

00:32:43.212 --> 00:32:44.752
Forget it. I'm off.

00:32:45.482 --> 00:32:47.522
I get that you've been through a lot.

00:32:49.222 --> 00:32:52.452
I understand you want to misbehave because you want to rebel.

00:32:53.492 --> 00:32:55.623
But stop toying with that naive guy's feelings.

00:32:56.363 --> 00:32:57.432
Please.

00:33:01.303 --> 00:33:02.403
Who said...

00:33:02.732 --> 00:33:04.333
I was toying with his feelings?

00:33:04.672 --> 00:33:06.602
You don't even like Yi Chan.

00:33:06.603 --> 00:33:08.343
Feelings constantly change.

00:33:09.712 --> 00:33:10.742
Forget it.

00:33:11.043 --> 00:33:12.643
You and Yi Chan can't be together anyway.

00:33:12.982 --> 00:33:14.413
He's meant to be with someone else.

00:33:14.643 --> 00:33:15.782
And who is that?

00:33:16.452 --> 00:33:17.512
Just someone.

00:33:18.452 --> 00:33:19.583
You don't need to know.

00:33:19.952 --> 00:33:23.553
I want your dad to become much happier than he is now.

00:33:23.793 --> 00:33:27.093
Someone who loves Yi Chan and cares for him more than anybody else.

00:33:27.492 --> 00:33:28.823
Even if I told you,

00:33:30.563 --> 00:33:31.863
you wouldn't believe me.

00:33:38.403 --> 00:33:39.472
It must be you.

00:33:40.672 --> 00:33:42.343
You have a crush on Yi Chan, don't you?

00:33:42.742 --> 00:33:45.042
What? What are you talking about?

00:33:45.043 --> 00:33:47.582
Come on. It's okay. I'm very open-minded.

00:33:47.583 --> 00:33:49.343
I have no bias against such things.

00:33:49.512 --> 00:33:51.853
- What are you talking about? - Don't worry.

00:33:52.413 --> 00:33:53.882
I won't tell anyone.

00:33:53.883 --> 00:33:56.952
However, we must compete fair and square.

00:33:57.793 --> 00:33:58.853
Good luck!

00:34:00.262 --> 00:34:01.293
Hey.

00:34:01.323 --> 00:34:03.691
It's not what you think! Hey!

00:34:03.692 --> 00:34:06.632
- My gosh. That was why. - It really isn't what you think.

00:34:06.633 --> 00:34:08.363
- Okay, I heard you. - Se Gyeong.

00:34:09.303 --> 00:34:10.502
Where have you been?

00:34:11.603 --> 00:34:12.803
I looked everywhere for you.

00:34:14.143 --> 00:34:15.143
No!

00:34:15.903 --> 00:34:17.472
What is this?

00:34:23.452 --> 00:34:24.512
- Se Gyeong! - Se Gyeong!

00:34:25.882 --> 00:34:27.483
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

00:34:29.523 --> 00:34:31.123
Get off me, will you?

00:34:31.623 --> 00:34:32.693
Gosh.

00:34:34.722 --> 00:34:37.063
Hey, let's talk.

00:34:37.492 --> 00:34:38.492
This is embarrassing.

00:34:45.873 --> 00:34:46.943
Darn it.

00:34:51.443 --> 00:34:52.643
Seriously, what's with you?

00:34:52.842 --> 00:34:54.281
You could've gotten hurt.

00:34:54.282 --> 00:34:55.841
Always look carefully when walking.

00:34:55.842 --> 00:34:58.282
What are you, my nanny? Superman?

00:34:58.413 --> 00:35:00.651
Do you suddenly feel a surge of strength...

00:35:00.652 --> 00:35:02.923
when something happens to people?

00:35:03.222 --> 00:35:05.023
You feel so powerful that you can't control yourself?

00:35:06.193 --> 00:35:07.221
Let's get going.

00:35:07.222 --> 00:35:08.261
It's almost time for your tutoring session.

00:35:08.262 --> 00:35:09.322
No!

00:35:09.932 --> 00:35:11.292
You should be helping me, if anything.

00:35:11.293 --> 00:35:14.902
Why must you ruin everything for me? Just why?

00:35:18.003 --> 00:35:19.602
Can't you just do as I say?

00:35:19.603 --> 00:35:21.943
- Do what? - Can't you just listen to me...

00:35:22.643 --> 00:35:24.071
without asking me...

00:35:24.072 --> 00:35:26.143
why I'm being like this or why I'm doing this?

00:35:27.143 --> 00:35:28.282
Just for a year.

00:35:29.213 --> 00:35:31.112
Just for one year, not your whole life.

00:35:31.452 --> 00:35:33.853
Can't you even stay by my side just for one year?

00:35:41.393 --> 00:35:42.522
No, guys.

00:35:42.523 --> 00:35:43.693
So that was what it was about.

00:35:44.532 --> 00:35:45.793
I knew it.

00:35:46.632 --> 00:35:48.302
I didn't know.

00:35:48.432 --> 00:35:50.333
Let's respect their preference...

00:35:50.603 --> 00:35:52.071
and pretend that we didn't see that just now.

00:35:52.072 --> 00:35:54.702
No, it's not what you think!

00:35:55.202 --> 00:35:58.373
Se Gyeong. It's not like that.

00:35:58.512 --> 00:36:00.841
It's okay. I didn't see anything.

00:36:00.842 --> 00:36:02.643
I'm not okay that you're okay.

00:36:03.112 --> 00:36:06.052
Hey, you, we'll talk about this later.

00:36:06.782 --> 00:36:07.923
Se Gyeong.

00:36:13.693 --> 00:36:15.163
It's late.

00:36:15.693 --> 00:36:17.362
I want to take you home.

00:36:17.793 --> 00:36:19.492
It won't take long by scooter.

00:36:19.663 --> 00:36:21.532
I'd like to give you a ride,

00:36:22.603 --> 00:36:24.471
but I promised to play fair with someone,

00:36:24.472 --> 00:36:25.572
so I can't do that.

00:36:28.802 --> 00:36:29.842
All right.

00:36:29.943 --> 00:36:32.043
Make sure to page me when you get home then.

00:36:32.512 --> 00:36:33.583
I gave you my number earlier.

00:36:34.043 --> 00:36:35.043
Okay.

00:36:35.044 --> 00:36:36.583
I'll page you as soon as I get home.

00:36:37.483 --> 00:36:39.051
I had so much fun thanks to you.

00:36:39.052 --> 00:36:41.122
I'll see you guys later. Bye.

00:36:41.123 --> 00:36:42.322
- Bye. - Bye.

00:36:47.893 --> 00:36:50.132
- Let's go. - Let's go.

00:36:50.592 --> 00:36:52.193
Keep more than three meters apart.

00:36:53.632 --> 00:36:54.663
Let's go together.

00:37:05.673 --> 00:37:06.742
It's not what you think.

00:37:09.182 --> 00:37:10.213
What?

00:37:11.713 --> 00:37:13.722
Yi Chan and I aren't a thing.

00:37:14.322 --> 00:37:16.222
I don't like him. I mean...

00:37:17.123 --> 00:37:18.623
It's not that I don't like him.

00:37:19.293 --> 00:37:20.762
I do like him,

00:37:21.322 --> 00:37:25.193
but not in the way you think.

00:37:25.862 --> 00:37:28.361
Anyway, Yi Chan and I...

00:37:28.362 --> 00:37:31.273
can never be a thing.

00:37:31.833 --> 00:37:33.873
I see.

00:37:34.802 --> 00:37:35.802
Okay.

00:37:36.813 --> 00:37:38.242
I know that it looks strange.

00:37:39.012 --> 00:37:40.682
But the reason why I am being strange...

00:37:42.282 --> 00:37:43.612
isn't because of Yi Chan.

00:37:44.313 --> 00:37:45.382
It's not?

00:37:47.552 --> 00:37:48.782
Then what's the reason?

00:37:49.583 --> 00:37:50.652
Actually,

00:37:52.293 --> 00:37:54.362
I have a secret I can't say.

00:37:55.193 --> 00:37:56.962
A secret? What secret?

00:37:56.963 --> 00:37:59.532
I can't say it. Because it's a secret I can't say.

00:38:08.302 --> 00:38:09.402
Do you perhaps...

00:38:12.572 --> 00:38:14.242
Do you like me?

00:38:15.083 --> 00:38:16.812
- What? - Think about it.

00:38:16.813 --> 00:38:18.451
Whenever I'm with Yi Chan,

00:38:18.452 --> 00:38:20.423
you interfere and interrupt us, keeping us in check.

00:38:20.652 --> 00:38:22.381
I'm sure it's out of jealousy.

00:38:22.382 --> 00:38:23.492
But you said it wasn't because of Yi Chan.

00:38:24.793 --> 00:38:26.092
It means you like me.

00:38:27.193 --> 00:38:28.792
I was trying to clear an issue,

00:38:28.793 --> 00:38:30.192
but now, I have another one.

00:38:30.193 --> 00:38:31.262
Bye.

00:38:34.963 --> 00:38:36.402
Be honest with me.

00:38:39.132 --> 00:38:40.503
Is it me?

00:38:40.773 --> 00:38:43.242
Or is it Yi Chan?

00:38:46.143 --> 00:38:47.182
Who is it?

00:39:01.393 --> 00:39:04.793
Don't be mistaken that everyone likes you.

00:39:05.432 --> 00:39:06.962
I'm not mistaken.

00:39:06.963 --> 00:39:08.233
Everyone likes me.

00:39:11.603 --> 00:39:12.932
I'm sorry, but you're not my type.

00:39:14.242 --> 00:39:15.242
Gosh.

00:39:16.402 --> 00:39:19.313
It's indeed fun to tease him.

00:39:26.213 --> 00:39:27.682
Let's get it together.

00:39:29.452 --> 00:39:31.693
Please get it together.

00:39:32.753 --> 00:39:34.893
- Please! - Oh, my goodness gracious.

00:39:35.663 --> 00:39:38.362
Are you worried about Se Gyeong who went home by herself?

00:39:38.862 --> 00:39:40.332
Give me your pager.

00:39:40.333 --> 00:39:42.032
I'll keep it until the lesson is over.

00:39:44.003 --> 00:39:45.003
Oh, my.

00:39:46.532 --> 00:39:48.202
Here comes Se Gyeong.

00:39:48.702 --> 00:39:49.702
Se Gyeong.

00:39:54.742 --> 00:39:55.813
Se Gyeong.

00:39:57.583 --> 00:39:58.682
Is this the phone number of your house?

00:39:59.782 --> 00:40:00.952
I'll save it in my heart.

00:40:02.923 --> 00:40:03.991
No.

00:40:03.992 --> 00:40:06.123
It's all good as long as you got home safely.

00:40:07.563 --> 00:40:09.361
Hang up when I'm being nice.

00:40:09.362 --> 00:40:10.991
The lesson isn't over yet.

00:40:10.992 --> 00:40:11.992
What?

00:40:12.663 --> 00:40:14.602
You heard something? It's nothing.

00:40:14.603 --> 00:40:16.901
It was a fly buzzing.

00:40:16.902 --> 00:40:17.971
"A fly?"

00:40:17.972 --> 00:40:19.942
Give it to me.

00:40:19.943 --> 00:40:21.172
- Hey. - Se Gyeong,

00:40:21.173 --> 00:40:22.673
I'll get back to you after I catch the fly.

00:40:30.213 --> 00:40:32.882
Se Gyeong, I caught it. You've been waiting for a long time.

00:40:33.322 --> 00:40:34.821
- Even my dad has never hit me. - I'm sorry.

00:40:34.822 --> 00:40:36.893
Come here.

00:40:38.393 --> 00:40:39.963
The fly is harder to catch than I thought.

00:40:42.092 --> 00:40:44.092
Hey. Stop.

00:40:48.003 --> 00:40:49.932
Don't call me a fly. Give it to me.

00:40:53.342 --> 00:40:55.143
I caught it.

00:40:56.813 --> 00:40:59.612
You want to change the final song? What are you talking about?

00:41:00.143 --> 00:41:02.082
It's for your mission as well.

00:41:02.083 --> 00:41:03.142
Will you be okay?

00:41:03.143 --> 00:41:04.813
Of course, I will.

00:41:05.213 --> 00:41:06.483
Se Gyeong told me to change it.

00:41:07.123 --> 00:41:08.182
Why all of a sudden?

00:41:08.753 --> 00:41:11.923
Actually, I asked her on the phone yesterday.

00:41:12.552 --> 00:41:15.663
That if the mission song was chosen to screw me up.

00:41:17.293 --> 00:41:18.393
They will misunderstand.

00:41:18.793 --> 00:41:19.833
And then?

00:41:21.202 --> 00:41:22.333
Change it, then.

00:41:22.833 --> 00:41:25.072
A band doesn't always have to do songs in English, does it?

00:41:25.503 --> 00:41:27.772
Korean music might top Billboard charts,

00:41:27.773 --> 00:41:30.612
making a foray into a global market someday.

00:41:30.873 --> 00:41:32.673
You also need to get ahead of your time.

00:41:33.543 --> 00:41:36.512
Gosh, the scale got bigger.

00:41:36.643 --> 00:41:38.381
I approve it. I approve it 100 percent.

00:41:38.382 --> 00:41:40.983
I approve of it too. The song was too hard anyway.

00:41:41.853 --> 00:41:43.083
Then I approve as well.

00:41:44.322 --> 00:41:45.353
I object.

00:41:46.862 --> 00:41:48.523
What are you guys doing?

00:41:49.623 --> 00:41:51.261
We don't even have a month until the festival.

00:41:51.262 --> 00:41:53.603
No. Even if we have more than enough time,

00:41:54.663 --> 00:41:56.971
does it make sense that we're changing it because she said so?

00:41:56.972 --> 00:41:58.031
Why does it not make sense?

00:41:58.032 --> 00:41:59.571
The one who made a bet told me to change it.

00:41:59.572 --> 00:42:00.773
What if she changes her mind?

00:42:01.402 --> 00:42:02.772
Then will you change it again to please her?

00:42:02.773 --> 00:42:03.813
Of course, I will.

00:42:04.242 --> 00:42:07.083
Se Gyeong gave up studying abroad and returned to Korea because of me.

00:42:07.282 --> 00:42:09.313
I'll do anything she wants.

00:42:09.983 --> 00:42:12.011
I'll put my life on it to keep my promise to her.

00:42:12.012 --> 00:42:13.582
Is the promise you made to me nothing then?

00:42:13.583 --> 00:42:14.952
My goodness.

00:42:15.423 --> 00:42:17.592
What promise did I make to you?

00:42:19.722 --> 00:42:20.722
Darn it.

00:42:21.393 --> 00:42:22.393
I got it.

00:42:23.793 --> 00:42:24.932
Then I'll leave.

00:42:26.632 --> 00:42:27.663
That will do.

00:42:30.072 --> 00:42:31.672
- Hey. - Hey.

00:42:31.673 --> 00:42:32.931
Look at him acting like he's the most important guy here...

00:42:32.932 --> 00:42:34.202
just because he can play the guitar.

00:42:34.773 --> 00:42:37.943
He must be the epitome of pettiness.

00:42:38.713 --> 00:42:40.543
What are you doing, you punk? Go after him right now.

00:42:41.413 --> 00:42:42.483
Hurry up.

00:42:44.012 --> 00:42:45.853
Stop right there when I'm being nice.

00:42:46.083 --> 00:42:47.983
Hey. For goodness' sake.

00:42:49.822 --> 00:42:52.022
You ruined the mood.

00:42:52.023 --> 00:42:54.122
Everyone likes the idea. Why are you making a fuss?

00:42:54.123 --> 00:42:55.623
Is the band a joke to you?

00:42:56.123 --> 00:42:57.663
Is it just bait to hook up with a girl?

00:42:58.432 --> 00:42:59.463
Someone...

00:43:00.733 --> 00:43:03.232
even messed up with their parents to become a member of a band.

00:43:03.233 --> 00:43:04.302
My goodness.

00:43:04.972 --> 00:43:06.201
Why do you have to bring up someone's parents...

00:43:06.202 --> 00:43:09.142
when I just want to change a song?

00:43:09.143 --> 00:43:10.672
Falling for those sugar-coated words,

00:43:10.673 --> 00:43:12.213
making a fool of yourself...

00:43:12.873 --> 00:43:14.742
You don't even remember the promise you made to me, do you?

00:43:15.043 --> 00:43:18.712
You don't care about anyone else except for Se Gyeong, right?

00:43:18.713 --> 00:43:20.753
Whatever. Just tell me.

00:43:21.023 --> 00:43:22.353
Are you staying in the band or not?

00:43:25.123 --> 00:43:26.123
Okay.

00:43:26.862 --> 00:43:27.862
I'll quit.

00:43:28.523 --> 00:43:29.722
I'm tired now.

00:43:31.932 --> 00:43:34.202
Whatever happens to you, it's not my business.

00:43:35.333 --> 00:43:36.362
I quit.

00:43:38.072 --> 00:43:39.773
Don't do something you're going to regret.

00:43:40.402 --> 00:43:42.572
If you leave like this, you can never come back.

00:43:43.043 --> 00:43:45.943
To the band and the guesthouse.

00:43:46.373 --> 00:43:48.443
Hey, I said you can never come back.

00:43:50.382 --> 00:43:51.413
Darn it!

00:43:52.612 --> 00:43:54.022
Water and oil don't mix.

00:43:54.023 --> 00:43:55.322
Right. Oh, my gosh.

00:43:56.023 --> 00:43:58.752
He's growing late. He hasn't even dated anyone.

00:43:58.753 --> 00:44:00.762
He's going through puberty just now.

00:44:01.222 --> 00:44:02.861
Why are you alone? What about Eun Gyeol?

00:44:02.862 --> 00:44:04.532
Forget it. Let's just practice.

00:44:05.032 --> 00:44:06.902
He'll come back once he cools off.

00:44:07.402 --> 00:44:09.602
That's what he will think, but no.

00:44:09.603 --> 00:44:10.632
I'm not going back ever again.

00:44:11.873 --> 00:44:13.702
(Used Musical Instruments)

00:44:14.103 --> 00:44:15.103
Hey, young man.

00:44:15.943 --> 00:44:18.873
You're the good son who wanted to get a guitar for your father, right?

00:44:19.443 --> 00:44:20.612
Hello.

00:44:20.813 --> 00:44:22.212
I found the perfect guitar.

00:44:22.213 --> 00:44:23.652
It's everything you were looking for.

00:44:24.213 --> 00:44:26.151
Come inside and check it out. If you like it, it's yours.

00:44:26.152 --> 00:44:27.882
I'll match the price you want.

00:44:28.052 --> 00:44:30.353
No. I don't need it anymore.

00:44:30.652 --> 00:44:31.692
Bye.

00:44:31.693 --> 00:44:34.023
(Used Musical Instruments)

00:44:38.362 --> 00:44:39.432
They fought.

00:44:40.092 --> 00:44:41.663
He and his father must have fought.

00:44:47.643 --> 00:44:50.612
(Woori Mart)

00:45:09.092 --> 00:45:10.563
Thank you.

00:45:10.793 --> 00:45:13.492
Please buy something tasty with this.

00:45:15.103 --> 00:45:17.402
I'm sorry to leave without saying goodbye, Grandma.

00:45:19.202 --> 00:45:20.342
But...

00:45:21.842 --> 00:45:23.273
you see,

00:45:25.012 --> 00:45:28.112
watching the immature version of Dad is too much for me to handle.

00:45:40.963 --> 00:45:42.123
I'm home.

00:45:48.902 --> 00:45:50.673
Why are you alone? What about your tutor?

00:45:52.132 --> 00:45:53.373
That punk hasn't come home yet?

00:45:53.742 --> 00:45:55.802
How rude!

00:45:56.342 --> 00:45:58.412
How dare you call your tutor like that?

00:45:58.413 --> 00:46:00.413
He's not some dog next door. He's your tutor.

00:46:00.742 --> 00:46:02.643
Grandma, you'll hurt my feelings if you keep scolding me like this.

00:46:02.813 --> 00:46:05.452
People might think that I'm just a servant,

00:46:05.483 --> 00:46:07.452
and he's your real grandson.

00:46:08.083 --> 00:46:10.292
Then you shouldn't have come home without him.

00:46:10.293 --> 00:46:12.551
He went to your school this afternoon to see you.

00:46:12.552 --> 00:46:13.623
Did you not see him?

00:46:13.822 --> 00:46:14.862
Oh, that.

00:46:15.362 --> 00:46:17.492
We did meet at my school.

00:46:17.733 --> 00:46:19.162
But he went to Chuncheon...

00:46:19.163 --> 00:46:20.862
because he had something to take care of.

00:46:21.262 --> 00:46:23.672
Do you need me to put the laundry in the Apple Room?

00:46:23.673 --> 00:46:25.531
Put it down gently. Don't mess it up.

00:46:25.532 --> 00:46:26.532
Okay.

00:46:26.533 --> 00:46:27.902
Right. Yi Chan.

00:46:28.003 --> 00:46:30.373
I found this while doing laundry. Is this yours?

00:46:32.342 --> 00:46:35.112
Oh, that. Someone dropped it on the street.

00:46:35.313 --> 00:46:37.713
I see. Then you should return it right away.

00:46:38.052 --> 00:46:40.722
It seemed perfectly fine, but I ended up washing that too.

00:46:40.923 --> 00:46:43.753
Forget it. I can't talk to her anyway. It's a hassle.

00:46:44.492 --> 00:46:46.193
Gosh. That punk.

00:46:47.693 --> 00:46:50.632
I was thinking about boiling chicken with some ginseng.

00:46:51.063 --> 00:46:52.862
I wonder if he will be back by tomorrow.

00:47:02.273 --> 00:47:04.742
He's definitely going through a rebellious phase. Seriously.

00:47:06.713 --> 00:47:08.443
So you took your backpack too?

00:47:09.213 --> 00:47:10.652
Are you that upset?

00:47:11.282 --> 00:47:12.612
Let's see how long you last.

00:47:12.682 --> 00:47:14.382
Only you will suffer if you leave.

00:47:17.853 --> 00:47:19.523
It's nice to have the room to myself.

00:47:30.233 --> 00:47:34.043
You don't care about anyone else except for Se Gyeong, right?

00:47:35.603 --> 00:47:36.773
He and his lectures. Darn it.

00:47:37.313 --> 00:47:38.673
You'd better not come back.

00:47:41.813 --> 00:47:43.083
This room is nice and big.

00:47:54.063 --> 00:47:55.892
Kid.

00:47:55.893 --> 00:47:57.293
Wake up.

00:47:57.463 --> 00:47:58.532
Kid.

You can't fall asleep in front of my store.

00:48:08.702 --> 00:48:10.043
Did you run away from home?

00:48:10.943 --> 00:48:12.742
Should I call the police?

00:48:12.972 --> 00:48:14.043
No.

00:48:15.242 --> 00:48:16.782
I'm sorry.

00:48:49.483 --> 00:48:50.512
Hello.

00:48:50.713 --> 00:48:52.652
Good evening.

00:48:55.682 --> 00:48:58.792
So? Have you found out the reason you're here?

00:48:58.793 --> 00:48:59.822
No.

00:49:00.623 --> 00:49:03.193
Forget it. Everything's just a mess.

00:49:03.563 --> 00:49:06.062
My dad is out of his mind and fixated on his first love.

00:49:06.063 --> 00:49:07.802
I have no idea where my mom is.

00:49:07.963 --> 00:49:10.471
People got the wrong idea about me. I got into a huge fight with my dad.

00:49:10.472 --> 00:49:11.932
Nothing's going my way.

00:49:12.273 --> 00:49:14.143
Oh, no. You poor thing.

00:49:16.402 --> 00:49:18.572
Forget about the mission. I just want to go home.

00:49:19.012 --> 00:49:20.642
I don't want that immature version of Ha Yi Chan.

00:49:20.643 --> 00:49:22.112
I miss my real dad.

00:49:23.143 --> 00:49:24.213
I miss my mom...

00:49:24.782 --> 00:49:26.413
and Eun Ho too.

00:49:27.483 --> 00:49:31.793
So please send me back home. Please?

00:49:32.092 --> 00:49:33.491
That's too bad.

00:49:33.492 --> 00:49:36.563
The door of space and time won't be opening anytime soon.

00:49:37.762 --> 00:49:39.893
Then when will it open again?

00:49:40.163 --> 00:49:42.862
- You'll find out in due time. - Are you serious right now?

00:49:43.032 --> 00:49:44.732
You made me travel back in time without my permission.

00:49:44.733 --> 00:49:46.873
How could you keep telling me such irresponsible things?

00:49:48.342 --> 00:49:49.673
If you leave now,

00:49:49.842 --> 00:49:54.213
2023 will be very different from what you're used to.

00:49:55.282 --> 00:49:56.882
Do you still want to go back?

00:49:57.382 --> 00:49:58.452
What...

00:49:59.913 --> 00:50:00.922
do you mean?

00:50:00.923 --> 00:50:03.322
Oh, no. You must not have known.

00:50:04.123 --> 00:50:06.522
The moment you arrived here,

00:50:06.523 --> 00:50:08.923
everything started to change.

00:50:31.583 --> 00:50:32.611
It's you.

00:50:32.612 --> 00:50:34.023
Yes, I am.

00:50:35.652 --> 00:50:38.853
I'm Yoon Dong Jin.

00:50:39.793 --> 00:50:40.923
I don't think you are.

00:50:41.523 --> 00:50:42.793
What should I do to make you believe that?

00:50:42.923 --> 00:50:45.532
The moment you pretended to be someone,

00:50:45.762 --> 00:50:49.003
history started to change little by little.

00:50:49.532 --> 00:50:52.773
The same goes for the fate of the people you crossed paths.

00:50:53.132 --> 00:50:54.242
Their fate must have changed too.

00:50:54.443 --> 00:50:57.472
You said I wasn't supposed to come back.

00:50:57.612 --> 00:51:00.341
I was curious what would happen if I didn't listen to you.

00:51:00.342 --> 00:51:01.442
Is that a good enough answer?

00:51:01.443 --> 00:51:02.443
No way.

00:51:04.552 --> 00:51:06.983
My dad's first love suddenly came back.

00:51:08.322 --> 00:51:10.822
Their reunion wasn't supposed to happen, but it did.

00:51:12.193 --> 00:51:14.123
I caused all of these changes?

00:51:15.063 --> 00:51:16.092
I'm not sure.

00:51:16.222 --> 00:51:19.792
But changes can cause more changes.

Stop acting like a know-it-all with your vague comments.

00:51:21.663 --> 00:51:23.563
Just give me a hint or something.

00:51:23.702 --> 00:51:25.272
Tell me how I can fix this...

00:51:25.273 --> 00:51:26.801
or how I can stop my dad's accident.

00:51:26.802 --> 00:51:28.442
Or tell me how I can find my mom.

00:51:28.443 --> 00:51:30.372
Just tell me what to do, please.

00:51:30.373 --> 00:51:33.213
Oh, no. I have already given you all of the hints.

00:51:33.543 --> 00:51:34.742
What hints?

That's tomorrow.

00:52:32.873 --> 00:52:35.242
Does it mean I'll be able to get a clue there?

00:52:37.302 --> 00:52:40.312
It's the first electric guitar Jinsung is launching.

00:52:40.313 --> 00:52:42.212
So my father has high hopes for this product.

00:52:42.213 --> 00:52:45.151
As I'm here today on behalf of the chairman,

00:52:45.152 --> 00:52:47.552
we must have a successful event no matter what.

00:52:47.923 --> 00:52:49.423
Is everything going according to plan?

Well,

00:52:51.923 --> 00:52:53.722
we have a problem.

00:52:54.592 --> 00:52:55.722
A problem?

00:52:55.893 --> 00:52:57.861
The weather forecast says there will be heavy rain...

00:52:57.862 --> 00:52:59.592
along with thunder and lightning this afternoon.

00:52:59.833 --> 00:53:00.861
We can proceed with...

00:53:00.862 --> 00:53:03.003
the press conference and the indoor event as planned.

00:53:03.132 --> 00:53:06.131
It may be prudent for us to postpone the outdoor event for now.

00:53:06.132 --> 00:53:07.472
What are you talking about?

00:53:08.302 --> 00:53:09.502
We're revealing our product for the first time today.

00:53:09.503 --> 00:53:11.172
We must be in the limelight.

00:53:11.173 --> 00:53:13.213
Don't you know if we postpone it, people will lose interest?

00:53:13.773 --> 00:53:15.982
That's true. But they issued an alert for heavy rain.

00:53:15.983 --> 00:53:17.482
Listen. I was told that...

00:53:17.483 --> 00:53:18.951
the majority of the participants are in their 20s.

00:53:18.952 --> 00:53:20.312

00:53:20.313 --> 00:53:22.222
They can handle some raindrops.

00:53:23.583 --> 00:53:25.693

(Seowon Arts High School)

00:57:06.112 --> 00:57:07.242
Let me carry you.

00:57:23.123 --> 00:57:24.693
(Celebratory Audition of Launching Jinsung Phoenix Standard)

00:57:45.213 --> 00:57:49.253
Okay. What a nice performance by Participant Nine.

00:57:50.353 --> 00:57:54.322
All right. Last but not least. Participant Ten.

00:57:54.623 --> 00:57:57.163
This is the performance of the last participant.

00:58:09.443 --> 00:58:10.503
He's handsome.

00:58:12.072 --> 00:58:13.872
It looks like it's going to rain anytime now.

00:58:13.873 --> 00:58:15.812
Why don't we stop now?

00:58:15.813 --> 00:58:17.753
He's the last one.

00:58:18.612 --> 00:58:19.682
Let's keep going.

00:58:23.182 --> 00:58:24.753
- What? - What's this?

00:58:40.233 --> 00:58:42.902
- Oh, no! - No!

00:58:43.242 --> 00:58:44.612
Call an ambulance right now!

00:58:44.742 --> 00:58:46.511
- Oh, no! - He collapsed!

00:58:46.512 --> 00:58:47.813
- He passed out! - Sir, we should go.

00:58:51.583 --> 00:58:53.583
Hey, are you all right?

00:59:03.623 --> 00:59:04.663
That's so funny.

00:59:08.963 --> 00:59:11.902
What? Gosh. Come on.

00:59:43.702 --> 00:59:46.503
(Out of order)

00:59:59.813 --> 01:00:02.253
A patient coming through. Please step aside.

01:00:03.083 --> 01:00:05.893
- Please step aside. - We have a patient. Please move.

01:00:06.353 --> 01:00:07.393
Dad.

01:00:08.222 --> 01:00:10.192
Where's the ER?

01:00:10.193 --> 01:00:11.462
What's wrong with her?

01:00:11.463 --> 01:00:13.091
She lost consciousness and collapsed.

01:00:13.092 --> 01:00:14.602
- She needs help now! - This way.

01:00:14.603 --> 01:00:15.733
What's her name?

01:00:15.932 --> 01:00:17.362
It's Yoon Chung Ah.

01:00:25.012 --> 01:00:26.012
Mom.

01:00:50.402 --> 01:00:53.233

01:01:20.432 --> 01:01:25.273
(Twinkling Watermelon)

01:01:25.472 --> 01:01:26.673
We're friends starting now.

01:01:27.003 --> 01:01:28.802
Yoon Chung Ah.

01:01:29.003 --> 01:01:31.241
He called my name.

01:01:31.242 --> 01:01:34.042
By the way, what happened to your sidekick?

01:01:34.043 --> 01:01:35.111
He left.

01:01:35.112 --> 01:01:36.412
But he has no place to go.

01:01:36.413 --> 01:01:38.151
What about Eun Gyeol? He's not coming?

01:01:38.152 --> 01:01:40.381
Whatever. If you want him, you go and look for him.

01:01:40.382 --> 01:01:42.252
I'm looking for someone. Can you take a look at this?

01:01:42.253 --> 01:01:44.252
Only Ha Eun Gyeol can be the main guitarist of our band.

01:01:44.253 --> 01:01:45.491
I will find him no matter what.

01:01:45.492 --> 01:01:47.991
I must find Ha Eun Gyeol and check it myself.

01:01:47.992 --> 01:01:51.091
Mom. Dad. I want to come home.

01:01:51.092 --> 01:01:52.833
I'm doing very well.

01:01:52.963 --> 01:01:54.603
Don't ever call me again.
