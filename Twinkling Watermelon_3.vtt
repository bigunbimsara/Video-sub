00:00:21.288 --> 00:00:22.759
(Ryeo Un)

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:25.958
(Choi Hyun Wook)

00:00:28.058 --> 00:00:29.659
(Seol In Ah)

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:36.639
(Shin Eun Soo)

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:47.895
(Twinkling Watermelon)

00:00:50.912 --> 00:00:51.918
(All people, organizations, locations, and incidents...)

00:00:51.942 --> 00:00:52.947
(in this drama are fictitious.)

00:00:52.971 --> 00:00:54.057
(Staff ensured child actors' safety in the filming of this drama.)

00:00:54.081 --> 00:00:56.342
This is a Pythagorean prime. We have 1, 2,

00:00:56.742 --> 00:00:57.928
and square root of five.

00:00:57.952 --> 00:01:01.052
We have a 4 on this side. These sides are 3 and 5. That's it.

00:01:01.231 --> 00:01:02.378
This is 2 square root of 10.

00:01:02.402 --> 00:01:04.241
It's 2 square root of 10.

00:01:04.302 --> 00:01:05.601
Two square root of ten.

00:01:05.771 --> 00:01:06.848
Then we have everything we need.

00:01:06.872 --> 00:01:08.192
How can we figure this out, then?

00:01:08.671 --> 00:01:10.247
Use the Ptolemy's theorem.

00:01:10.271 --> 00:01:11.881
- We can just use that theorem.
- Yes.

00:01:12.112 --> 00:01:13.112
I did it.

00:01:13.582 --> 00:01:15.082
Gosh, that brat.

00:01:18.281 --> 00:01:19.381
Goal.

00:01:20.052 --> 00:01:21.092
Hey.

00:01:21.922 --> 00:01:24.692
If you want to waste your life, get out of my class.

00:01:30.431 --> 00:01:31.431
Sir.

00:01:31.931 --> 00:01:33.972
When was the era of glory for you?

00:01:34.431 --> 00:01:36.448
Was it when you passed the exam to be a schoolteacher?

00:01:36.472 --> 00:01:38.241
Was it when you married your wife?

00:01:38.741 --> 00:01:39.771
Or...

00:01:40.371 --> 00:01:41.612
was it when your son was born?

00:01:41.812 --> 00:01:43.372
I don't have a child. I'm divorced too.

00:01:43.741 --> 00:01:44.881
What nonsense is this?

00:01:48.911 --> 00:01:49.952
My era...

00:01:53.082 --> 00:01:54.192
is now.

00:01:58.161 --> 00:02:00.097
- Get out of my class now then.
- I'm sorry.

00:02:00.121 --> 00:02:01.838
- Get out.
- I didn't know you were divorced.

00:02:01.862 --> 00:02:03.467
- I'm sorry.
- You brat. Get out now.

00:02:03.491 --> 00:02:05.107
- Get out. You little...
- Okay.

00:02:05.131 --> 00:02:07.232
Gosh. That brat. Seriously.

00:02:09.631 --> 00:02:11.901
My name is Ha Yi Chan. I'm 18 years old now.

00:02:12.071 --> 00:02:13.571
My life is twinkling to the fullest.

00:02:16.672 --> 00:02:17.842
Pedal faster!

00:02:18.511 --> 00:02:19.942
Come on. Let's go!

00:02:21.112 --> 00:02:22.881
It was the spring of 1995.

00:02:23.151 --> 00:02:24.831
There was no doubt that I was in my youth.

00:02:25.021 --> 00:02:27.721
My youth radiated without much effort that spring.

00:02:28.121 --> 00:02:31.862
I met other young kids who would change my life completely.

00:02:36.862 --> 00:02:38.762
(Used Books, The Day)

00:02:39.332 --> 00:02:40.362
Thanks.

00:02:44.672 --> 00:02:46.377
Sir, did you get any new issues of "Slam Dunk?"

00:02:46.401 --> 00:02:47.518
Check the bookshelf over there.

00:02:47.542 --> 00:02:48.542
What about "Dragon Ball?"

00:02:48.642 --> 00:02:49.962
Check the shelf above the stairs.

00:03:21.672 --> 00:03:24.912
The first person to change my life completely was...

00:03:27.811 --> 00:03:28.851
"My left hand is there..."

00:03:29.811 --> 00:03:30.882
"solely as support."

00:03:31.251 --> 00:03:34.021
Kang Baek Ho, the epitome of innocence and positive energy.

00:03:34.091 --> 00:03:36.452
He'll forever be my comic brother.

00:03:42.262 --> 00:03:43.292
Choi Se Gyeong.

00:03:43.491 --> 00:03:45.461
My queen. My muse.

00:03:46.262 --> 00:03:47.239
And...

00:03:47.263 --> 00:03:48.471
You should be in a band then.

00:03:48.771 --> 00:03:51.148
They worship guys in a band.

00:03:51.172 --> 00:03:52.941
What is this? Why did you just pop up?

00:03:53.142 --> 00:03:54.548
He's not that important. Let's skip him.

00:03:54.572 --> 00:03:56.088
Hey, wait.

00:03:56.112 --> 00:03:57.988
Why are you skipping me? What are you doing?

00:03:58.012 --> 00:03:59.382
Come here, you punk.

00:04:00.651 --> 00:04:03.582
Gosh. I'll give you a really good deal for that.

00:04:04.151 --> 00:04:06.922
I'm supposed to charge you 23 dollars.

00:04:08.691 --> 00:04:10.051
But you can buy it for 20 dollars.

00:04:10.591 --> 00:04:11.768
What's that look on your face?

00:04:11.792 --> 00:04:14.262
Okay. You have a likable face.

00:04:15.191 --> 00:04:16.232
Then...

00:04:17.191 --> 00:04:19.602
I'll be reasonable. Just give me 12 dollars.

00:04:20.461 --> 00:04:22.208
- Thank you.
- My close friend's...

00:04:22.232 --> 00:04:23.209
girlfriend's brother...

00:04:23.233 --> 00:04:25.278
goes to Baekwang High School, so I'm giving you a good deal.

00:04:25.302 --> 00:04:26.302
Okay.

00:04:27.711 --> 00:04:28.917
Kurt Cobain.

00:04:28.941 --> 00:04:31.612
The legendary band musician. The idol of the ladies.

00:04:34.652 --> 00:04:37.128
His life sparkled the most intensely, albeit briefly,

00:04:37.152 --> 00:04:39.482
and taught me a piece of truth.

00:04:39.881 --> 00:04:41.328
- Se Gyeong.
- Se Gyeong.

00:04:41.352 --> 00:04:44.097
- It's Se Gyeong.
- What's going on?

00:04:44.121 --> 00:04:46.402
- She looks great in that shirt.
- Gosh, she's so pretty.

00:04:46.922 --> 00:04:48.292
My gosh. Why is he not here?

00:04:57.772 --> 00:05:00.347
The only way to win over a beauty like her...

00:05:00.371 --> 00:05:02.018
for a poor guy with no connections like me is...

00:05:02.042 --> 00:05:03.542
I guess you like bands as well.

00:05:04.641 --> 00:05:06.081
You should've told me.

00:05:06.842 --> 00:05:07.912
Actually,

00:05:10.381 --> 00:05:11.422
I'm in a band too.

00:05:14.891 --> 00:05:15.891
Se Gyeong.

00:05:16.522 --> 00:05:18.761
Do you want to come to our concert later?

00:05:22.061 --> 00:05:23.861
My school is having a festival a month later.

00:05:24.061 --> 00:05:25.902
I will prepare a performance, just for you.

00:05:26.032 --> 00:05:27.009
Please come to watch me.

00:05:27.033 --> 00:05:28.208
Does your band actually exist?

00:05:28.232 --> 00:05:29.902
- I'm going to make one now.
- What?

00:05:30.431 --> 00:05:31.542
I bought this T-shirt.

00:05:32.042 --> 00:05:33.641
I also bought a guitar pick.

00:05:33.941 --> 00:05:35.912
I'm ready to show you my affection.

00:05:36.272 --> 00:05:38.581
I just need to start my band. You'll come, right?

00:05:39.212 --> 00:05:40.412
Why would I?

00:05:40.482 --> 00:05:41.982
I'm making the band just for you...

00:05:42.081 --> 00:05:43.557
and putting on the concert just for you too.

00:05:43.581 --> 00:05:45.552
Besides, there will be a spot, just for you.

00:05:45.722 --> 00:05:50.121
- Give him an answer.
- Give him an answer.

00:05:53.321 --> 00:05:54.568
- What?
- What's going on?

00:05:54.592 --> 00:05:56.467
Se Gyeong, I didn't peg you to be such a bold woman.

00:05:56.491 --> 00:05:58.302
- Sure.
- Really?

00:05:59.532 --> 00:06:01.831
Did you really just say, "sure?"

00:06:03.931 --> 00:06:04.941
But...

00:06:05.802 --> 00:06:07.441
- I have conditions.
- Go ahead.

00:06:07.811 --> 00:06:09.518
What are the conditions? Just tell me!

00:06:09.542 --> 00:06:10.942
But you must promise me this first.

00:06:11.282 --> 00:06:12.758
If you can't keep your promise,

00:06:12.782 --> 00:06:14.811
you will never show up in front of me ever again.

00:06:14.881 --> 00:06:17.482
Fine. But you need to promise me something too.

00:06:17.821 --> 00:06:19.722
If I keep my promise,

00:06:19.881 --> 00:06:21.722
give me a chance to be your boyfriend.

00:06:22.792 --> 00:06:24.467
The chance of that happening is close to zero.

00:06:24.491 --> 00:06:26.162
The world of possibility is unbelievable.

00:06:27.292 --> 00:06:28.991
Tell me what the conditions are.

00:06:29.261 --> 00:06:31.462
Firstly, it must be a new band.

00:06:31.532 --> 00:06:32.578
You'd better stop now...

00:06:32.602 --> 00:06:34.347
if you're thinking about joining an already successful band.

00:06:34.371 --> 00:06:36.607
Secondly, you must already know how to play an instrument.

00:06:36.631 --> 00:06:37.878
You will have to do a solo performance.

00:06:37.902 --> 00:06:39.772
Thirdly, I will pick the song.

00:06:40.001 --> 00:06:41.588
If you're thinking about picking an easy song,

00:06:41.612 --> 00:06:42.692
you might as well stop now.

00:06:43.842 --> 00:06:46.212
What do you say? Are you still in?

00:06:47.112 --> 00:06:48.987
Of course. What's the title?

00:06:49.011 --> 00:06:50.571
- What's the title?
- What's the title?

00:06:51.052 --> 00:06:52.029
What's the title?

00:06:52.053 --> 00:06:53.613
- What's the title?
- What's the title?

00:06:55.092 --> 00:06:57.321
"Come as You Are" by Nirvana.

00:07:01.761 --> 00:07:03.532
Hey, can you actually do it?

00:07:03.831 --> 00:07:06.302
- That was insane.
- Can you really do it?

00:07:17.112 --> 00:07:19.311
- Are you sure about this?
- What do you mean?

00:07:19.641 --> 00:07:20.782
The bet.

00:07:22.311 --> 00:07:23.751
What if he pulls it off?

00:07:24.652 --> 00:07:25.898
He will never be able to pull it off.

00:07:25.922 --> 00:07:27.522
How can you be so certain?

00:07:27.751 --> 00:07:28.998
I could tell just by looking at his fingers.

00:07:29.022 --> 00:07:31.398
Those weren't the hands of a man who could play an instrument.

00:07:31.422 --> 00:07:33.162
Then why did you play along?

00:07:33.462 --> 00:07:35.302
That innocent boy must be excited for nothing.

00:07:35.792 --> 00:07:37.578
He will need people to play in a band.

00:07:37.602 --> 00:07:39.562
The song by Nirvana isn't easy to perform either.

00:07:39.602 --> 00:07:41.248
He will be busy forming a band and practicing the song.

00:07:41.272 --> 00:07:42.912
He won't be bothering me for a while now.

00:07:43.402 --> 00:07:44.379
When he fails his mission,

00:07:44.403 --> 00:07:46.083
he'll be too embarrassed to show his face.

00:07:46.272 --> 00:07:48.371
But you might have overlooked something.

00:07:49.342 --> 00:07:50.319
What do you mean?

00:07:50.343 --> 00:07:52.011
A boy in love...

00:07:52.842 --> 00:07:55.881
can sometimes have superpowers.

00:07:58.282 --> 00:08:00.821
I will bet ten dollars that he will succeed.

00:08:01.422 --> 00:08:04.522
Come on. Whose side are you on?

00:08:07.162 --> 00:08:09.131
- You want to make what?
- A band.

00:08:09.662 --> 00:08:13.001
You're not talking about the Band-Aid, right?

00:08:13.232 --> 00:08:15.152
- That was a joke, right?
- You're crazy, right?

00:08:15.272 --> 00:08:17.472
Bands aren't something you can just form overnight.

00:08:17.532 --> 00:08:19.201
Apparently, that's possible.

00:08:19.741 --> 00:08:21.441
- How?
- Baekwang Band.

00:08:21.672 --> 00:08:23.212
Are you talking about our school band?

00:08:37.621 --> 00:08:39.261
Performances by attention-seekers.

00:08:39.891 --> 00:08:41.261
A group of nutcases.

00:08:41.962 --> 00:08:43.138
Every time they performed,

00:08:43.162 --> 00:08:44.338
they competed against each other to stand out.

00:08:44.362 --> 00:08:45.977
So the only sane member, their guitarist,

00:08:46.001 --> 00:08:46.978
transferred to another school.

00:08:47.002 --> 00:08:48.722
In the end, the band was forced to disband.

00:08:49.101 --> 00:08:51.278
- That Baekwang Band?
- Yes.

00:08:51.302 --> 00:08:53.547
They said yes when I promised them dates with college girls.

00:08:53.571 --> 00:08:55.891
Are you crazy? What could you possibly do with those guys?

00:08:56.512 --> 00:08:57.882
Hey, my friend.

00:08:58.581 --> 00:09:00.657
The name, Baekwang Band,

00:09:00.681 --> 00:09:04.628
has already vanished into thin air as a part of their humiliating past.

00:09:04.652 --> 00:09:05.629
So now...

00:09:05.653 --> 00:09:09.691
(First Love Memory Manipulators)

00:09:10.522 --> 00:09:11.522
Did you see that?

00:09:11.961 --> 00:09:14.492
I will be the first love of every girl out there.

00:09:14.961 --> 00:09:18.431
Se Gyeong will especially lose her memory completely.

00:09:19.032 --> 00:09:20.032
Right.

00:09:21.331 --> 00:09:22.971
You're my band's manager.

00:09:23.372 --> 00:09:24.941
- Congratulations.
- What?

00:09:25.471 --> 00:09:28.512
- Gosh. No. Never. I don't want...
- My friend.

00:09:28.772 --> 00:09:30.841
Welcome to The Manipulators.

00:09:35.512 --> 00:09:38.022
You definitely promised us dates with dance majors.

00:09:38.481 --> 00:09:40.498
I'll kill you if you bring martial arts majors.

00:09:40.522 --> 00:09:42.552
What? Have you been lied to your whole life?

00:09:42.922 --> 00:09:44.052
I'm sure you've heard of it.

00:09:44.252 --> 00:09:45.968
Getting a room in Snail Guesthouse...

00:09:45.992 --> 00:09:47.792
is harder than getting accepted into college.

00:09:48.361 --> 00:09:49.892
My grandmother runs the guesthouse.

00:09:50.861 --> 00:09:52.181
Isn't that a men-only guesthouse?

00:09:52.302 --> 00:09:54.238
No college girls can stay in that guesthouse.

00:09:54.262 --> 00:09:55.348
You must not know that...

00:09:55.372 --> 00:09:57.372
all these men go to prestigious universities.

00:09:57.902 --> 00:09:59.878
Their girlfriends are flight attendants,

00:09:59.902 --> 00:10:02.172
ballerinas, and designers.

00:10:06.012 --> 00:10:07.488
How much time do we have left until the show?

00:10:07.512 --> 00:10:09.392
We have 1 month and 10 days until the festival.

00:10:09.481 --> 00:10:11.152
- We have enough time.
- Okay.

00:10:12.282 --> 00:10:13.382
Then...

00:10:14.221 --> 00:10:16.152
show us what you got, frontman.

00:10:16.591 --> 00:10:17.622
Of course.

00:10:19.221 --> 00:10:20.691
This is the moment of truth.

00:10:35.012 --> 00:10:36.642
Two, three, four.

00:11:02.372 --> 00:11:03.532
What? Why did you stop?

00:11:05.272 --> 00:11:07.672
- Are you nervous?
- This is all I've got.

00:11:08.311 --> 00:11:10.547
How could he be so nonchalant about this?

00:11:10.571 --> 00:11:11.681
Am I the only one,

00:11:11.782 --> 00:11:13.457
itching to throw a few punches? It's been a while.

00:11:13.481 --> 00:11:15.087
Hey, I'm a vocalist.

00:11:15.111 --> 00:11:16.927
I can just do a good job with the intro.

00:11:16.951 --> 00:11:19.758
I will play by myself during the intro.

00:11:19.782 --> 00:11:22.067
You guys can play your instruments while I sing.

00:11:22.091 --> 00:11:23.152
Darn it.

00:11:23.622 --> 00:11:25.382
Do you think we're some backup band for you?

00:11:25.492 --> 00:11:29.108
If you want to sing, go to karaoke and sing by yourself.

00:11:29.132 --> 00:11:30.731
Hey, calm down.

00:11:31.302 --> 00:11:32.778
Yi Chan, just give it up.

00:11:32.802 --> 00:11:34.772
You can't have a band without a guitarist.

00:11:35.902 --> 00:11:37.231
You heard your friend, right?

00:11:37.431 --> 00:11:38.542
Unbelievable.

00:11:38.872 --> 00:11:40.502
It was awful meeting you.

00:11:40.841 --> 00:11:42.587
Let's not see each other again.

00:11:42.611 --> 00:11:43.611
Let's go.

00:11:45.081 --> 00:11:48.152
Wait!

00:11:49.211 --> 00:11:50.211
Wait.

00:11:51.181 --> 00:11:54.022
Okay. I understand what you're saying.

00:11:54.351 --> 00:11:56.552
Let's get someone then. Let's do it!

00:11:57.591 --> 00:12:00.067
I'll recruit an awesome guitarist.

00:12:00.091 --> 00:12:01.132
Are you that dumb?

00:12:01.731 --> 00:12:03.638
We don't have time to recruit a guitarist and practice with him.

00:12:03.662 --> 00:12:05.537
We'll need someone like Yoon Dong Jin to make this work.

00:12:05.561 --> 00:12:07.731
Yoon Dong Jin? Who is that?

00:12:08.971 --> 00:12:10.372
I'll bring him then!

00:12:11.032 --> 00:12:13.118
Do you even know who Yoon Dong Jin is?

00:12:13.142 --> 00:12:14.172
Dong Jin.

00:12:15.571 --> 00:12:16.711
I know him very well.

00:12:18.111 --> 00:12:19.211
I knew it.

00:12:19.782 --> 00:12:21.351
See? What did I tell you?

00:12:21.851 --> 00:12:24.628
I told you he might know Dong Jin because he's from Chuncheon.

00:12:24.652 --> 00:12:27.228
Anyone can know him. Knowing him personally matters.

00:12:27.252 --> 00:12:29.022
I know who Yoon Dong Jin is too.

00:12:29.292 --> 00:12:30.451
Yoon Dong Jin.

00:12:30.992 --> 00:12:32.337
The genius guitarist...

00:12:32.361 --> 00:12:34.608
in the second year at Chuncheon National University of Education.

00:12:34.632 --> 00:12:37.667
He gave a song he wrote at the age of 13 to a professional singer.

00:12:37.691 --> 00:12:41.101
He's a talented musician in songwriting as well.

00:12:41.372 --> 00:12:44.672
Gosh, he was one of my students, but he was indeed special.

00:12:44.772 --> 00:12:46.778
You taught Yoon Dong Jin?

00:12:46.802 --> 00:12:47.841
Oh, no.

00:12:48.512 --> 00:12:50.512
I said something I shouldn't have said.

00:12:51.681 --> 00:12:54.557
The truth is, I'm the one who taught him how to play the guitar.

00:12:54.581 --> 00:12:56.827
Gosh. Have some of this.

00:12:56.851 --> 00:12:59.122
It's nicely grilled. It's Chuncheon-style spicy chicken.

00:12:59.321 --> 00:13:00.351
Let me try it.

00:13:03.851 --> 00:13:05.162
It smells just like Chuncheon.

00:13:05.591 --> 00:13:06.662
Bal San.

00:13:07.522 --> 00:13:09.638
Can you give Dong Jin a call?

00:13:09.662 --> 00:13:12.002
- Please?
- Yi Chan, it's burning. Flip it.

00:13:13.902 --> 00:13:16.471
Hey, you're burning it. Come on.

00:13:18.672 --> 00:13:21.002
But why do you need me to call him?

00:13:21.272 --> 00:13:24.218
The truth is, he formed a band.

00:13:24.242 --> 00:13:26.858
He needs to invite a guitarist at the last minute.

00:13:26.882 --> 00:13:27.927
He must do it before the festival.

00:13:27.951 --> 00:13:30.427
Gosh. I wonder if Dong Jin will do it.

00:13:30.451 --> 00:13:31.797
Perform with a high school band?

00:13:31.821 --> 00:13:34.181
That's why I'm asking you to call him.

00:13:34.752 --> 00:13:36.067
If you don't want to talk to him directly,

00:13:36.091 --> 00:13:37.068
give me his number.

00:13:37.092 --> 00:13:38.692
I'm good at kneeling in front of people.

00:13:39.122 --> 00:13:40.191
You brat.

00:13:41.231 --> 00:13:42.231
Wait.

00:13:48.701 --> 00:13:51.218
Dong Jin is a night owl.

00:13:51.242 --> 00:13:53.242
So I don't think he will pick up the phone now.

00:13:53.701 --> 00:13:56.272
I'll call his oldest brother instead.

00:13:57.471 --> 00:13:58.481
Hey.

00:14:07.951 --> 00:14:08.968
Hello.

00:14:08.992 --> 00:14:10.522
- Hello.
- He answered it.

00:14:10.951 --> 00:14:13.292
I'm Bal San from Chuncheon.

00:14:13.561 --> 00:14:14.691
Who is this?

00:14:14.892 --> 00:14:16.691
I think you got the wrong number.

00:14:17.292 --> 00:14:18.961
Gosh. I know.

00:14:19.831 --> 00:14:22.632
By the way, what's Dong Jin up to these days?

00:14:23.601 --> 00:14:26.471
What? He disappeared?

00:14:27.071 --> 00:14:29.811
He went to Mount Odae four days ago...

00:14:30.111 --> 00:14:31.711
to work on a song?

00:14:32.542 --> 00:14:34.542
It's impossible to reach him?

00:14:34.782 --> 00:14:37.087
Mount Odae? Are you kidding me?

00:14:37.111 --> 00:14:38.358
- You jerk.
- Okay.

00:14:38.382 --> 00:14:40.128
- How dare you make a prank call...
- All right...

00:14:40.152 --> 00:14:41.868
- in the middle of the afternoon?
- Okay. Bye.

00:14:41.892 --> 00:14:43.492
You're totally disturbing my sleep.

00:14:46.561 --> 00:14:47.622
So that's it.

00:14:47.861 --> 00:14:49.738
Bal San, can you at least give me his phone number?

00:14:49.762 --> 00:14:51.162
I'm sorry I couldn't help you.

00:14:51.561 --> 00:14:53.532
I need to get going. I have an appointment too.

00:15:07.282 --> 00:15:10.587
This is the online forum all the talented musicians are on.

00:15:10.611 --> 00:15:12.651
I've seen a lot of recruitment posts for bands too.

00:15:13.382 --> 00:15:14.427
Who knows?

00:15:14.451 --> 00:15:16.368
Maybe, Yoon Dong Jin might check this forum.

00:15:16.392 --> 00:15:17.851
- Let's post one.
- Sounds good.

Hold on. The bait is too insignificant.

00:15:25.331 --> 00:15:26.738
We won't be able to hook him with this.

00:15:26.762 --> 00:15:29.122
Then what can we hook him with? Should we offer earthworms?

00:15:32.272 --> 00:15:33.478
Tell him we'll offer room and board.

00:15:33.502 --> 00:15:35.941

you join our bad,

Excuse me for being forward in my first message to you.

00:16:25.321 --> 00:16:27.191
as a special guest of our band.

00:16:53.922 --> 00:16:56.321
- Hello. This is Snail...
- Hey. He wrote back!

00:16:56.652 --> 00:16:58.762
Yoon Dong Jin wrote a post on the online forum!

00:17:00.321 --> 00:17:01.532

Hello, I'm Yoon Dong Jin.

00:17:25.121 --> 00:17:27.258
I was actually planning to go to Seoul soon,

00:17:27.282 --> 00:17:29.151
so I was looking for a place to stay.

00:17:29.621 --> 00:17:32.492
Reading your offer at the Snail Guesthouse was perfect.

00:17:33.792 --> 00:17:35.792
I feel so honored and lucky.

00:17:36.331 --> 00:17:39.532
I will gladly join you...

00:17:40.032 --> 00:17:41.278
as a guest member for the festival.

00:17:41.302 --> 00:17:43.302
- Hi, how can I help you?
- Hi.

00:17:44.002 --> 00:17:46.518
Do you have any rock albums?

00:17:46.542 --> 00:17:48.442
Rock? Just a second.

00:17:48.811 --> 00:17:50.518
So he's going to be standing there with the school newspaper?

00:17:50.542 --> 00:17:53.012
Yes. I said we would be wearing school uniforms.

00:17:53.182 --> 00:17:54.342
So he will recognize us soon.

00:17:55.151 --> 00:17:58.528
But I looked into Yoon Dong Jin. He seems quite unique.

00:17:58.552 --> 00:18:00.658
He's a little whimsical and quirky.

00:18:00.682 --> 00:18:01.668
- Ma Joo.
- Yes?

00:18:01.692 --> 00:18:03.692
He's a musician. That's how geniuses are.

00:18:04.452 --> 00:18:05.938
Anyway, you should curry favor with him.

00:18:05.962 --> 00:18:08.037
Don't say something anything stupid and make him change his mind.

00:18:08.061 --> 00:18:09.232
Don't worry.

00:18:09.361 --> 00:18:11.441
The horoscope said I would be extremely lucky today.

00:18:11.532 --> 00:18:12.561
What did it say?

00:18:12.901 --> 00:18:15.678

00:19:07.651 --> 00:19:09.097
How could you not know who Oh Ma Joo is?

00:19:09.121 --> 00:19:10.601
You know who Yoon Dong Jin is, right?

00:19:10.651 --> 00:19:11.637
Of course, I do.

00:19:11.661 --> 00:19:13.261
He's the godfather of Korean band music.

00:19:14.192 --> 00:19:16.508
Oh Ma Joo is the one who helped Yoon Dong Jin...

00:19:16.532 --> 00:19:18.292
become the number one artist in the country.

00:19:18.561 --> 00:19:20.921
Could they be the Oh Ma Joo and Yoon Dong Jin I know about?

00:19:21.032 --> 00:19:22.032
Then...

00:19:23.002 --> 00:19:24.432
Who...

00:19:24.671 --> 00:19:27.617
I'm the frontman of the band, First Love Memory Manipulators.

00:19:27.641 --> 00:19:30.311
My name is Ha Yi Chan.

00:19:32.311 --> 00:19:34.911
"Ha Yi Chan?"

00:19:36.081 --> 00:19:37.182
Ha Yi Chan?

00:19:37.252 --> 00:19:38.282
Dad?

00:19:44.022 --> 00:19:45.061
It's Dad.

00:19:46.462 --> 00:19:47.522
Dad...

00:19:48.661 --> 00:19:49.732
can talk.

00:19:51.061 --> 00:19:53.107
- Are you really Dad?
- I don't think I am.

00:19:53.131 --> 00:19:55.448
Ha Yi Chan, born in 1978, Year of the Horse, right?

00:19:55.472 --> 00:19:58.718
Unless I've been lied to about my birth, that's probably right.

00:19:58.742 --> 00:20:00.278
You grew with up your grandma who ran a guesthouse...

00:20:00.302 --> 00:20:02.748
until you were in high school. Her name is Go Yang Hee.

00:20:02.772 --> 00:20:04.518
And the name of the guesthouse is Snail. Am I right?

00:20:04.542 --> 00:20:06.658
Excuse me. Dong Jin, let's go somewhere to...

00:20:06.682 --> 00:20:08.887
Am I right? Answer me right now!

00:20:08.911 --> 00:20:09.952
Yes, you're right.

00:20:12.482 --> 00:20:13.921
But how can Dad speak?

00:20:13.982 --> 00:20:16.222
Because I have a mouth. Can you just allow me to speak?

00:20:16.391 --> 00:20:18.462
Why have you not been talking to me?

00:20:18.692 --> 00:20:20.652
I thought you couldn't speak since you were born.

00:20:20.861 --> 00:20:22.732
And why are you in a band?

00:20:24.292 --> 00:20:26.101
How about Mom? Where is she?

00:20:27.532 --> 00:20:29.202
It's a UFO.

00:20:30.532 --> 00:20:31.532
My goodness.

00:20:32.242 --> 00:20:34.278
You can't leave me behind.

00:20:34.302 --> 00:20:36.071
I don't know anyone in this area.

00:20:36.742 --> 00:20:37.787
Dad!

00:20:37.811 --> 00:20:39.012
I'm not your dad!

00:20:51.591 --> 00:20:53.121
He...

00:20:53.821 --> 00:20:55.161
- Gosh.
- Oh, gosh.

00:20:56.992 --> 00:20:58.962
Hey, are you sure he's just whimsical?

00:20:59.161 --> 00:21:00.807
He's just on another level.

00:21:00.831 --> 00:21:02.147
I warned you.

00:21:02.171 --> 00:21:03.978
That it wouldn't be easy to deal with him.

00:21:04.002 --> 00:21:06.641
He's crazy. He called me Dad.

00:21:06.901 --> 00:21:08.718
I would've gotten in trouble if Se Gyeong had heard that.

00:21:08.742 --> 00:21:10.742
What do we do? Should we cancel our plan?

00:21:10.871 --> 00:21:12.111
Should we give up on our band?

00:21:12.881 --> 00:21:15.357
But is he actually Yoon Dong Jin?

00:21:15.381 --> 00:21:16.581
Yes, I am.

00:21:18.581 --> 00:21:21.752
I'm Yoon Dong Jin.

00:21:21.921 --> 00:21:23.821
I don't think you are.

00:21:24.651 --> 00:21:26.331
What should I do to make you believe that?

00:21:30.591 --> 00:21:31.568
Which school do you go to?

00:21:31.592 --> 00:21:32.978
CNUE, entered in 1994, mathematics education major.

00:21:33.002 --> 00:21:34.938
- What instruments can you play?
- I'm amazing at guitar and bass.

00:21:34.962 --> 00:21:36.748
Better than average on the keyboard and quite good at drums.

00:21:36.772 --> 00:21:39.412
- When did you start playing guitar?
- When I was in elementary...

00:21:39.442 --> 00:21:40.478
When I was a fourth grader.

00:21:40.502 --> 00:21:42.988
- Date of birth?
- March 21, 1975.

00:21:43.012 --> 00:21:44.948
My baby bump nickname is Bambi, the deer.

00:21:44.972 --> 00:21:46.617
Do you even know that?

00:21:46.641 --> 00:21:48.317
Of course. He's a legend in Korea's band scene.

00:21:48.341 --> 00:21:50.958
If you read his magazine interviews, you can get all that information.

00:21:50.982 --> 00:21:53.297
Gosh, he said he was a legend himself.

00:21:53.321 --> 00:21:54.651
He's indeed crazy.

00:21:55.421 --> 00:21:56.597
Where did we talk to each other for the first time?

00:21:56.621 --> 00:21:57.797
A club bulletin board on a PC network.

00:21:57.821 --> 00:21:59.361
Why do you keep calling me Dad?

00:22:02.492 --> 00:22:04.172
Because you look like the Father of Music.

00:22:05.661 --> 00:22:06.821
What was my first impression?

00:22:06.901 --> 00:22:08.208
You were much more handsome than I thought,

00:22:08.232 --> 00:22:09.371
which was surprising.

00:22:09.772 --> 00:22:10.802
Pass!

00:22:11.002 --> 00:22:13.418
Welcome to First Love Memory Manipulators.

00:22:13.442 --> 00:22:14.442
Yes.

00:22:15.171 --> 00:22:16.442
(In front of Hongik University)

00:22:24.252 --> 00:22:25.821
I guess it's your first time in Seoul.

00:22:25.952 --> 00:22:28.492
No, it's not. I've been living in Seoul since I was born.

00:22:34.121 --> 00:22:35.292
I was joking.

00:22:35.361 --> 00:22:38.081
I was born and raised in Chuncheon, and it's my first time in Seoul.

00:22:39.302 --> 00:22:41.232
It's my first time in Seoul in 1995, though.

00:22:42.671 --> 00:22:44.932
Anyway, he's quite unique.

00:22:45.032 --> 00:22:46.141
Don't you think so, Ma Joo?

00:22:48.942 --> 00:22:52.512
Okay. Oh, my. The bus is coming.

00:23:04.821 --> 00:23:06.968
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

00:23:06.992 --> 00:23:10.192
I lost my wallet and all my cash.

00:23:10.661 --> 00:23:13.601
What do I do? I only have commutation tickets.

00:23:13.762 --> 00:23:14.861
"Commutation tickets?"

00:23:16.571 --> 00:23:18.742
Oh, well. You look way younger than your age, so...

00:23:22.371 --> 00:23:24.018
I got another commutation ticket.

00:23:24.042 --> 00:23:25.881
Here are two tickets for two.

00:23:28.212 --> 00:23:29.351
This must be a dream.

00:23:29.851 --> 00:23:32.421
I just had an argument with my dad before going out.

00:23:33.081 --> 00:23:35.651
Now, I'm with my dad who is the same age as me.

00:23:35.921 --> 00:23:37.292
And he can speak.

00:23:37.891 --> 00:23:39.361
He's even a member of a band.

00:23:40.262 --> 00:23:41.661
This must be a dream.

00:23:48.702 --> 00:23:50.008
- Hey.
- Yes?

00:23:50.032 --> 00:23:51.371
I feel so uncomfortable.

00:23:51.772 --> 00:23:53.702
His stare is so intense that it could fry me.

00:23:57.141 --> 00:23:59.982
By the way, when did you come down from Mount Odae?

00:24:00.081 --> 00:24:01.117
- "Mount Odae?"
- What?

00:24:01.141 --> 00:24:02.188
- What?
- What?

00:24:02.212 --> 00:24:03.812
I heard you were working on music there.

00:24:03.952 --> 00:24:06.022
Oh, that one?

00:24:07.381 --> 00:24:10.621
Oh, right. I went to Mount Odae to work on music.

00:24:13.091 --> 00:24:14.571
It hasn't been long since I got back.

00:24:16.631 --> 00:24:17.631
Like yesterday?

00:24:17.732 --> 00:24:18.802
I see.

00:24:19.732 --> 00:24:20.732
Oh, right.

00:24:21.601 --> 00:24:24.107
Can I speak more casually since we'll be working together?

00:24:24.131 --> 00:24:25.171
Excuse me?

00:24:25.841 --> 00:24:28.542
I know people don't care about Confucian values anymore, but...

00:24:29.212 --> 00:24:30.287
It means no.

00:24:30.311 --> 00:24:32.182
No, I don't mind.

00:24:32.411 --> 00:24:33.688
You can speak casually.

00:24:33.712 --> 00:24:34.742
Really?

00:24:35.712 --> 00:24:37.811
You speak casually first then.

00:24:38.212 --> 00:24:39.722
How can I...

00:24:39.752 --> 00:24:41.712
Come on, treat me as if I'm your younger brother.

00:24:42.052 --> 00:24:43.492
Call me Yi Chan.

00:24:44.222 --> 00:24:45.992
"Yi Chan." Come on.

00:24:52.302 --> 00:24:53.302
Yi...

00:24:58.331 --> 00:25:00.472
- Yi Chan.
- Yes, Dong Jin.

00:25:00.702 --> 00:25:01.841
Did you call me?

00:25:02.042 --> 00:25:03.712
We should get off at this stop.

00:25:03.911 --> 00:25:06.182
- Let's go.
- But...

00:25:06.942 --> 00:25:08.311
where are we going?

00:25:13.581 --> 00:25:15.222
So who is this person?

00:25:15.452 --> 00:25:18.762
The Son of Chuncheon. The genius guitarist, Yoon Dong Jin.

00:25:20.391 --> 00:25:21.621
I told you I would bring him.

00:25:25.631 --> 00:25:28.532
It was last fall...

00:25:29.802 --> 00:25:32.478
when we went to the festival at CNUE.

00:25:32.502 --> 00:25:33.542
Yes.

00:25:34.702 --> 00:25:36.942
And finally, he came on the stage.

00:25:37.542 --> 00:25:39.111
With a blinding halo.

00:25:39.611 --> 00:25:40.811
Oh, my gosh.

00:25:41.712 --> 00:25:42.782
Thanks.

00:25:44.012 --> 00:25:45.621
He didn't need a band.

00:25:46.182 --> 00:25:47.998
His guitar alone could cover all the bass riffs, drum parts,

00:25:48.022 --> 00:25:49.198
and melody lines as well.

00:25:49.222 --> 00:25:51.268
Hyun Yul, what a lengthy greeting.

00:25:51.292 --> 00:25:54.421
- That's enough. Let's practice.
- I was so excited to meet him...

00:25:54.992 --> 00:25:56.861
that I even went to the sauna last night.

00:25:57.631 --> 00:25:59.607
I had no idea that you'd fool me like this.

00:25:59.631 --> 00:26:01.307
What do you mean? Explain so I can understand...

00:26:01.331 --> 00:26:03.691
Isn't it obvious? Do I have to spell it out for you? Idiot!

00:26:03.871 --> 00:26:06.542
This jerk. He's not Yoon Dong Jin.

00:26:07.341 --> 00:26:09.718
What? What do you mean he's not Yoon Dong Jin?

00:26:09.742 --> 00:26:10.817
Why are you so naive?

00:26:10.841 --> 00:26:12.718
Do you not have a brain?

00:26:12.742 --> 00:26:15.452
Dong Jin, you tell us.

00:26:15.651 --> 00:26:17.158
Oh, me?

00:26:17.182 --> 00:26:20.022
You were standing at that spot, holding the magazine.

00:26:20.282 --> 00:26:21.797
You know a lot about my grandma's guesthouse,

00:26:21.821 --> 00:26:23.952
about me, and about you as well...

00:26:28.061 --> 00:26:29.192
In fact, you know too much.

00:26:30.861 --> 00:26:32.061
Way too much.

00:26:33.401 --> 00:26:34.432
Do you get it now?

00:26:35.401 --> 00:26:37.678
Do you know what this is called?

00:26:37.702 --> 00:26:40.002
This is called fraud, you idiot.

00:26:40.601 --> 00:26:42.341
You guys are so dead.

00:26:44.371 --> 00:26:45.482
Darn it.

00:26:49.411 --> 00:26:51.158
If I see you, you're dead meat.

00:26:51.182 --> 00:26:52.428
You'd better behave yourself.

00:26:52.452 --> 00:26:54.728
You little... I should've known better when you joined the band...

00:26:54.752 --> 00:26:56.998
just because you were head over heels for Choi Se Gyeong.

00:26:57.022 --> 00:26:58.321
Darn you!

00:27:00.321 --> 00:27:02.891
(First Love Memory Manipulators)

00:27:06.361 --> 00:27:09.871
So, you're not Yoon Dong Jin?

00:27:11.472 --> 00:27:12.502
So...

00:27:13.341 --> 00:27:15.341
you joined the band because of a girl?

00:27:16.242 --> 00:27:18.317
You little... Who are you?

00:27:18.341 --> 00:27:20.641
- Who is Choi Se Gyeong?
- Are you out of your mind?

00:27:21.081 --> 00:27:22.988
You duped me. How dare you mess with me?

00:27:23.012 --> 00:27:24.428
Look who's talking. Dad, are you crazy?

00:27:24.452 --> 00:27:26.097
You're cheating at age 18?

00:27:26.121 --> 00:27:28.921
Am I Handel? Why do you keep calling me "Dad?"

00:27:29.192 --> 00:27:31.692
Handel is the mother of music. Bach is the father of music.

00:27:31.992 --> 00:27:33.998
Dad, you're supposed to be in love with Yoon Chung Ah!

00:27:34.022 --> 00:27:36.131
Who is Yoon Chung Ah?

00:27:52.942 --> 00:27:54.442
(Thanks for this.)

00:27:58.752 --> 00:28:01.022
Oh, it's Frida Kahlo's painting.

00:28:01.452 --> 00:28:02.792
I love this painting too.

00:28:18.002 --> 00:28:19.841
You're always wearing your earphones.

00:28:22.212 --> 00:28:23.242
Yes, your earphones.

00:28:23.841 --> 00:28:24.847
Why are you wearing them all the time?

00:28:24.871 --> 00:28:25.881
You can't hear anyway.

00:28:28.482 --> 00:28:31.411
Oh, that's not what I meant.

00:28:32.222 --> 00:28:33.282
I'm sorry.

00:28:47.462 --> 00:28:49.171
You're listening to the beats.

00:28:55.101 --> 00:28:56.141
Do you like band music?

00:29:05.081 --> 00:29:06.452
Do you like band music?

00:29:11.091 --> 00:29:12.992
I see. That's cool.

00:29:18.532 --> 00:29:20.331
Do you like that guy?

00:29:23.302 --> 00:29:24.371
"That guy?"

00:29:25.972 --> 00:29:27.042
Who?

00:29:39.052 --> 00:29:40.782
(Do you like that guy?)

00:29:50.391 --> 00:29:51.891
(Do you like that guy?)

00:29:53.331 --> 00:29:55.831
Oh, I guess you saw us that day.

00:29:57.331 --> 00:29:58.601
Do I like him?

00:30:01.542 --> 00:30:03.611
No. Not at all.

00:30:09.611 --> 00:30:10.811
But I find him amusing,

00:30:11.252 --> 00:30:12.722
like a fun comic book.

00:30:13.022 --> 00:30:15.022
One that makes you curious about the next episode.

00:30:20.121 --> 00:30:21.391
Hey, Yoon Chung Ah!

00:30:22.492 --> 00:30:23.962
Oh, that's right. She can't hear.

00:30:25.432 --> 00:30:26.702
What a hassle.

00:30:32.171 --> 00:30:35.202
(The homeroom teacher said to come to the teachers' office now.)

00:30:35.542 --> 00:30:38.111
Min A, is this really your painting?

00:30:39.381 --> 00:30:40.411
Yes.

00:30:42.381 --> 00:30:44.151
The art teacher brought this...

00:30:44.252 --> 00:30:46.121
and said you kept copying Chung Ah's work.

00:30:47.222 --> 00:30:48.552
You tell us the truth.

00:30:49.421 --> 00:30:51.851
Whose painting is the original? Who copied whom?

00:30:53.091 --> 00:30:54.837
Sir, this is so unfair.

00:30:54.861 --> 00:30:55.891
What's unfair?

00:30:56.131 --> 00:30:58.768
Why are you interrogating me and not her?

00:30:58.792 --> 00:31:01.607
You're already assuming that I copied her!

00:31:01.631 --> 00:31:03.732
My goodness. Stop crying at once.

00:31:04.101 --> 00:31:05.671
You did nothing to be proud of.

00:31:06.171 --> 00:31:07.678
Thank goodness we checked before you submitted this.

00:31:07.702 --> 00:31:09.702
This would've been so embarrassing for the school.

00:31:10.071 --> 00:31:12.758
Anyway, we can't submit this to the contest. Just know that.

00:31:12.782 --> 00:31:15.542
No. Please submit it for me, sir.

00:31:15.712 --> 00:31:18.287
I need to win more awards to go to college.

00:31:18.311 --> 00:31:21.222
No. Controversial applications will be denied.

00:31:21.522 --> 00:31:22.728
That's the rule.

00:31:22.752 --> 00:31:24.632
Why are you standing there? Take your painting.

00:31:47.641 --> 00:31:49.528
See? What did I tell you?

00:31:49.552 --> 00:31:51.528
I said you wouldn't be able to fool our homeroom teacher.

00:31:51.552 --> 00:31:53.022
Shut your mouth, will you?

00:32:00.161 --> 00:32:01.192
That witch.

00:32:01.861 --> 00:32:03.408
She won't even participate in the contest anyway.

00:32:03.432 --> 00:32:05.091
Why must she get in my way?

00:32:06.161 --> 00:32:08.831
I bet she was the one who told the chairwoman on me.

00:32:09.502 --> 00:32:11.702
Chung Ah won't be participating in the contest?

00:32:12.032 --> 00:32:13.042
Why not?

00:32:13.302 --> 00:32:15.448
She's not satisfied with her painting.

00:32:15.472 --> 00:32:16.488
My gosh.

00:32:16.512 --> 00:32:18.272
She thinks she's a real artist or something.

00:32:18.641 --> 00:32:21.817
But then again, her stepmother is the chairwoman of the school.

00:32:21.841 --> 00:32:23.327
No wonder none of the teachers scares her,

00:32:23.351 --> 00:32:25.511
and she's not even worried about getting into college.

00:32:26.381 --> 00:32:28.458
She got into this school thanks to the special admission program.

00:32:28.482 --> 00:32:30.192
The one for students with disabilities.

00:32:31.252 --> 00:32:33.121
Gosh, that scared me. What's with her?

00:32:38.032 --> 00:32:40.432
- My gosh. Has she lost her mind?
- She must be going crazy.

00:32:40.802 --> 00:32:42.972
Yes, keep acting up like that.

00:32:48.341 --> 00:32:49.341
What?

00:33:02.351 --> 00:33:03.421
Hey!

00:33:04.192 --> 00:33:05.252
Oh, no!

00:33:05.651 --> 00:33:07.037
- Hey!
- Break it up!

00:33:07.061 --> 00:33:08.768
- Hey!
- What are you two doing?

00:33:08.792 --> 00:33:11.438
- Hey, stop!
- Let go!

00:33:11.462 --> 00:33:13.508
- Hey!
- Let go!

00:33:13.532 --> 00:33:15.478
- Girls!
- You two can talk it out!

00:33:15.502 --> 00:33:17.171
What? Mom was his first love?

00:33:17.671 --> 00:33:19.391
He's never loved another woman in his life?

00:33:20.841 --> 00:33:23.111
But he joined the band because of another girl?

00:33:23.671 --> 00:33:25.811
I'm so disappointed. He totally let me down.

00:33:26.282 --> 00:33:27.458
If this is a dream, I'll wake up.

00:33:27.482 --> 00:33:29.602
If this is real, I'll go back to the present at once.

00:33:32.452 --> 00:33:33.821
Wait. How do I go back?

00:33:34.581 --> 00:33:36.668
(Used Books, The Day)

00:33:36.692 --> 00:33:37.792
This is so weird.

00:33:46.331 --> 00:33:47.932
I swear, it was right here.

00:33:53.101 --> 00:33:54.671
(The Day)

00:33:56.641 --> 00:33:58.018
(Everyone needs a little sanctuary.)

00:33:58.042 --> 00:33:59.802
(We hope this place becomes your sanctuary.)

00:34:07.022 --> 00:34:09.192
Oh, hello. Can I help you find something?

00:34:09.792 --> 00:34:12.591
How long have you been running this secondhand bookstore here?

00:34:12.821 --> 00:34:14.661
About ten years.

00:34:14.792 --> 00:34:15.908
Why do you ask?

00:34:15.932 --> 00:34:18.008
Then don't you know La Vida Music? They sell musical instruments.

00:34:18.032 --> 00:34:19.161
"La Vida?"

00:34:19.831 --> 00:34:21.861
I've never heard of such a store before.

00:34:22.002 --> 00:34:23.972
It must be somewhere around here.

00:34:24.401 --> 00:34:26.201
Please try to remember if you've heard of it.

00:34:26.571 --> 00:34:28.348
I've been living and working in this area for years,

00:34:28.372 --> 00:34:30.572
but I've never heard of such a musical instrument shop.

00:34:31.412 --> 00:34:32.441
Really?

00:34:35.082 --> 00:34:36.528
I'm sorry for wasting your time.

00:34:36.552 --> 00:34:37.981
Gosh, don't worry about it.

00:34:39.151 --> 00:34:40.821
All right, then. Have a good day.

00:34:49.392 --> 00:34:50.492
No way.

00:34:51.131 --> 00:34:53.451
What if that door allows you to travel through dimensions?

00:34:55.001 --> 00:34:58.702
What if that door is the passage between the past and the present?

00:35:00.671 --> 00:35:02.372
Then, the moment I walk out the door,

00:35:03.242 --> 00:35:05.517
I could return to 2023.

00:35:05.541 --> 00:35:08.541
(The Day, Buy and Sell)

00:35:41.282 --> 00:35:43.052
(Used Books, The Day)

00:35:44.082 --> 00:35:45.158
Why am I still here?

00:35:45.182 --> 00:35:47.582
Why am I still in 1995?

00:35:48.421 --> 00:35:50.591
Was I wrong? Does the door only open at night?

00:35:52.352 --> 00:35:53.461
No way.

00:35:54.562 --> 00:35:56.362
What if I'm stuck here and can never go home?

00:35:58.091 --> 00:36:00.961
No. There must be a way.

00:36:01.302 --> 00:36:02.977
I must find a way. I will find a way.

00:36:03.001 --> 00:36:05.102
Do not lose this transaction slip.

00:36:05.802 --> 00:36:07.501
You'll be in a tight spot if you do. Okay?

00:36:27.892 --> 00:36:29.191
Oh, there's six cents left.

00:36:30.861 --> 00:36:32.808
- I'm sorry. My Wi-Fi isn't working.
- What?

00:36:32.832 --> 00:36:34.202
Sorry. I apologize.

00:36:41.602 --> 00:36:44.041
The number does not exist.

00:36:44.412 --> 00:36:46.912
Please check the number and try again.

00:36:48.082 --> 00:36:50.552
- The number does not exist.
- No!

00:36:50.981 --> 00:36:52.082
Please check the number...

00:37:01.622 --> 00:37:02.731
I'm starving.

00:37:07.802 --> 00:37:09.032
I'll give you the rest later.

00:37:18.041 --> 00:37:19.312
Come again soon!

00:37:22.111 --> 00:37:24.082
I'll have three servings of tteokbokki...

00:37:24.182 --> 00:37:25.627
and the fritters too. One of each.

00:37:25.651 --> 00:37:26.881
Sure. One moment, please.

00:37:27.452 --> 00:37:28.812
You accept 50-dollar bills, right?

00:37:28.881 --> 00:37:30.241
Gift certificates aren't accepted.

00:37:30.352 --> 00:37:32.052
I mean cash bills, not gift certificates.

00:37:36.432 --> 00:37:37.437
They're big.

00:37:37.461 --> 00:37:38.937
(10-dollar bills, 5-dollar bills)

00:37:38.961 --> 00:37:40.001
They're big.

00:37:40.702 --> 00:37:43.532
They're larger than the paper bills used in 2023.

00:37:43.771 --> 00:37:44.932
I'm sorry,

00:37:45.671 --> 00:37:48.302
but has the 50-dollar bill not been released yet?

00:37:48.771 --> 00:37:50.412
What nonsense.

00:37:51.142 --> 00:37:52.822
Anyway, do you want the tteokbokki or not?

00:38:02.651 --> 00:38:03.952
Master, darn you.

00:38:04.651 --> 00:38:06.361
If I see you again, you're so dead!

00:38:07.492 --> 00:38:09.191
If I see you again, you're so dead.

00:38:10.392 --> 00:38:13.272
I can't believe I met that imposter. I guess I should blame my bad luck.

00:38:25.742 --> 00:38:27.142
I'm home, Grandma.

00:38:27.381 --> 00:38:29.582
- Hey, you're back.
- Yes.

00:38:39.321 --> 00:38:41.062
Hey, why did you come home alone?

00:38:41.392 --> 00:38:42.392
What about your guest?

00:38:43.262 --> 00:38:44.461
- "Guest?"
- Yes.

00:38:44.662 --> 00:38:45.762
What guest?

00:38:45.832 --> 00:38:48.152
You know, from Chuncheon National University of Education.

00:38:48.602 --> 00:38:51.032
Anyway, you said you offered him room and board...

00:38:51.171 --> 00:38:53.041
in exchange for free tutoring sessions.

00:38:53.202 --> 00:38:55.147
Oh, that. I decided not to do it.

00:38:55.171 --> 00:38:56.812
- Why not?
- Grandma.

00:38:57.012 --> 00:38:58.642
I met him, and he's a con man.

00:38:58.711 --> 00:39:00.941
Why do you say that? Did he look scary?

00:39:01.041 --> 00:39:03.412
Yes, he looked so...

00:39:07.952 --> 00:39:10.598
I mean, he's got a nice face. He's quite good-looking.

00:39:10.622 --> 00:39:11.782
What? So why won't you do it?

00:39:12.892 --> 00:39:14.738
Did he look dumb?

00:39:14.762 --> 00:39:17.131
Yes! He's so...

00:39:18.131 --> 00:39:19.508
You were much more handsome than I thought,

00:39:19.532 --> 00:39:20.602
which was surprising.

00:39:23.032 --> 00:39:24.032
He looks smart.

00:39:25.032 --> 00:39:27.047
I don't know who his parents are, but he looked really smart.

00:39:27.071 --> 00:39:29.841
What? Then why didn't you bring him here?

00:39:30.211 --> 00:39:32.788
You just don't want to study. That's it, right?

00:39:32.812 --> 00:39:34.288
No, that's not it!

00:39:34.312 --> 00:39:37.552
Grandma, you don't know anything. Seriously!

00:39:38.151 --> 00:39:39.151
What in the world?

00:39:39.251 --> 00:39:42.992
Goodness. I thought it was the best thing you'd ever done.

00:39:45.021 --> 00:39:46.021
Hey.

00:39:48.492 --> 00:39:50.032
So? You two parted ways right away?

00:39:50.832 --> 00:39:53.113
Then what was I supposed to do? Have a gunfight with him?

00:39:53.162 --> 00:39:56.372
Then you should've called me and let me know.

00:39:56.832 --> 00:39:58.278
You said you'd bring him here,

00:39:58.302 --> 00:40:01.178
so I went grocery shopping and cooked up a storm all day.

00:40:01.202 --> 00:40:03.242
Why would you bother making food for him?

00:40:04.372 --> 00:40:06.317
Can't you see that your grandmother is talking?

00:40:06.341 --> 00:40:07.912
Don't you dare talk back to me.

00:40:08.512 --> 00:40:11.552
You said he came here all the way from Chuncheon.

00:40:12.082 --> 00:40:15.622
We should give him a warm welcome and take care of him.

00:40:16.021 --> 00:40:17.751
Is that how I raised you?

00:40:18.852 --> 00:40:20.861
No. I'm sorry.

00:40:23.032 --> 00:40:24.662
Wash up at once, and have some food.

00:40:25.231 --> 00:40:27.278
He must be exhausted after the long train ride.

00:40:27.302 --> 00:40:29.361
He should've at least stopped by for some food.

00:40:29.432 --> 00:40:31.602
You're so rude!

00:40:34.341 --> 00:40:35.341
Gosh.

00:40:36.941 --> 00:40:38.872
He's not a kid, so he won't starve.

00:40:40.012 --> 00:40:42.142
- Sorry, excuse me.
- Yes?

00:40:42.211 --> 00:40:45.412
I lost my wallet, so I don't have a single penny on me now.

00:40:47.182 --> 00:40:48.521
I wonder if he's eaten.

00:40:49.521 --> 00:40:50.892
He did look quite tired.

00:40:52.492 --> 00:40:53.521
What?

00:40:54.492 --> 00:40:56.832
Why do I care whether or not that jerk is starving?

00:40:57.892 --> 00:40:59.492
He's a despicable con man...

00:41:00.162 --> 00:41:02.322
and a complete stranger who has nothing to do with me!

00:41:06.242 --> 00:41:08.642
Okay, 1992...

00:41:09.302 --> 00:41:10.812
This is from 1990. Nice.

00:41:14.782 --> 00:41:15.812
This is from 1999.

00:41:19.852 --> 00:41:20.952
Oh, this is from 1991.

00:41:21.352 --> 00:41:22.452
Nice.

00:41:26.191 --> 00:41:27.461
Gosh, I feel much better now.

00:41:40.041 --> 00:41:41.071
Mom.

00:41:43.271 --> 00:41:44.972
Dad kicked me out.

00:41:48.312 --> 00:41:49.312
Mom.

00:41:52.111 --> 00:41:53.421
I feel so lost.

00:41:56.291 --> 00:41:57.321
Mom.

00:42:00.361 --> 00:42:03.432
I wish I could have your doenjang stew right now.

00:42:06.461 --> 00:42:07.562
Mom.

00:42:09.602 --> 00:42:10.702
Mom...

00:42:12.332 --> 00:42:15.541
That's right. I should look for Mom. Why hadn't I thought of that?

00:42:16.812 --> 00:42:18.771
Mom and Dad are the same age,

00:42:19.211 --> 00:42:20.812
so if I find her school...

00:42:22.142 --> 00:42:24.751
Mom, how come you don't have a single yearbook?

00:42:26.182 --> 00:42:28.952
I lost them all in a flood years ago.

00:42:31.552 --> 00:42:33.361
What about pictures of your parents?

00:42:33.861 --> 00:42:35.341
Do you have any other family members?

00:42:38.131 --> 00:42:39.231
No, I don't.

00:42:39.461 --> 00:42:41.562
I practically grew up an orphan.

00:42:42.001 --> 00:42:43.231
The rest is a secret.

00:42:44.032 --> 00:42:46.202
I'll tell you more when you're older, okay?

00:42:47.472 --> 00:42:48.472
Okay.

00:42:51.611 --> 00:42:52.611
I know nothing...

00:42:54.012 --> 00:42:55.012
about Mom.

00:43:07.722 --> 00:43:10.631
(Please use it as if it is your bathroom.)

00:43:29.642 --> 00:43:32.312
I thought I knew a lot about my parents, but I was wrong.

00:43:33.921 --> 00:43:35.521
I thought I knew enough about them,

00:43:36.691 --> 00:43:38.452
so I never made an effort to learn more.

00:43:40.921 --> 00:43:43.392
And at some point, I stopped being curious.

00:43:52.972 --> 00:43:55.041
I told you. I didn't eat it.

00:43:56.202 --> 00:43:57.571
Come on. I don't believe you.

00:44:08.481 --> 00:44:10.722
Cover yourself with it, or you'll freeze to death.

00:44:17.262 --> 00:44:19.332
My own worries always came first.

00:44:20.501 --> 00:44:22.762
My problems always took precedence over all else.

00:44:32.512 --> 00:44:33.881
I'm freezing.

00:44:36.412 --> 00:44:38.111
So I didn't know these things.

00:44:50.361 --> 00:44:52.992
The fact that Dad wasn't born deaf...

00:44:54.162 --> 00:44:56.482
and the reason Mom said she practically grew up an orphan.

00:45:07.082 --> 00:45:10.481
And that there was a time when Mom and Dad...

00:45:11.082 --> 00:45:13.481
were called by their own names, not just "Mom" and "Dad."

00:46:10.242 --> 00:46:12.448
- Hello?
- Hi, there.

00:46:12.472 --> 00:46:14.288
So? Are you enjoying your trip?

00:46:14.312 --> 00:46:15.881
Who are you, really?

00:46:16.441 --> 00:46:18.312
Why on earth are you doing this to me?

00:46:18.412 --> 00:46:19.727
Oh, no.

00:46:19.751 --> 00:46:22.127
I guess you're not really enjoying your trip.

00:46:22.151 --> 00:46:24.921
Why did you send me here?

00:46:25.151 --> 00:46:26.227
Well...

00:46:26.251 --> 00:46:28.567
Don't you think you should find the reason yourself?

00:46:28.591 --> 00:46:30.432
- Hey, mister!
- What?

00:46:33.361 --> 00:46:35.238
Then how can I go back?

00:46:35.262 --> 00:46:36.808
What can I do to return to the present?

00:46:36.832 --> 00:46:37.872
Well...

00:46:38.071 --> 00:46:40.271
That too. You'll have to figure it out on your own.

00:46:41.341 --> 00:46:43.488
Then give me a hint, at least!

00:46:43.512 --> 00:46:44.848
Tell me how I'm supposed to view this whole situation,

00:46:44.872 --> 00:46:46.488
some rules or missions, for example.

00:46:46.512 --> 00:46:49.611
I see. I guess that's what boys in the 21st century like.

00:46:50.151 --> 00:46:51.711
For now, just enjoy the ride.

00:46:51.952 --> 00:46:53.928
A trip is supposed to be fun, you know.

00:46:53.952 --> 00:46:56.381
Viva la vida!

00:46:57.222 --> 00:46:58.968
You'll hear from me again.

00:46:58.992 --> 00:47:00.622
All right, then. Bye.

00:47:02.591 --> 00:47:04.291

00:47:06.932 --> 00:47:10.032
Don't hang up, please!

00:47:39.332 --> 00:47:40.731
From the reason I ended up here...

00:47:42.762 --> 00:47:44.171
to how I can get back,

00:47:46.302 --> 00:47:47.982
I have to figure out everything on my own?

00:47:50.312 --> 00:47:51.341
That means...

00:47:53.881 --> 00:47:57.052
I'll be stuck here for a while.

It's all over.

00:48:23.912 --> 00:48:26.071
It's over? What do you mean?

00:48:26.271 --> 00:48:28.758
Yoon Dong Jin just posted on the forum,

00:48:28.782 --> 00:48:30.251
calling us con artists.

00:48:30.452 --> 00:48:31.452
What?

00:48:33.651 --> 00:48:36.357
Hey, that wasn't a con. It was just a misunderstanding.

00:48:36.381 --> 00:48:38.198
That's what you think.

00:48:38.222 --> 00:48:40.091
Hey, let's go meet him now.

00:48:40.262 --> 00:48:41.897
We should apologize to him properly in person,

00:48:41.921 --> 00:48:43.138
clear up the misunderstanding,

00:48:43.162 --> 00:48:45.242
- and officially ask him to join...
- It's too late.

00:48:47.832 --> 00:48:49.337
approached him and recruited him on the spot.

It's game over.

00:48:56.472 --> 00:48:59.142
First, post a public apology on the forum.

00:48:59.211 --> 00:49:00.288
Then let's post another ad to...

00:49:00.312 --> 00:49:02.718
He also posted a warning telling people not to be fooled...

00:49:02.742 --> 00:49:04.702
even if they saw our ad looking for a new member.

My gosh. This guy is a good writer.

People are going wild over this.

00:49:09.622 --> 00:49:10.622
In the band scene,

00:49:12.622 --> 00:49:14.222
we're already done for.

00:49:22.231 --> 00:49:23.571
Give up already, Yi Chan.

00:49:24.271 --> 00:49:25.707
It's always beautiful to see those...

who leave because they know it's time to give up.

- Do you think Se Gyeong knows too?
- What?

00:49:31.171 --> 00:49:32.611
That the band is done for.

00:49:32.812 --> 00:49:34.288
Goodness. I'm sure she knows.

00:49:34.312 --> 00:49:35.488
I hear people are betting money...

00:49:35.512 --> 00:49:37.793
on whether or not we can pull this off, so she must know.

Where are you going?

00:49:42.352 --> 00:49:44.291
I must tell Se Gyeong the truth.

00:49:44.722 --> 00:49:46.321
She'll understand.

No, to find a new member.

I'm going to tell Se Gyeong that we're starting over.

00:49:59.401 --> 00:50:01.941
I'll tell her to just ignore the rumors and wait for me.

Wait. Would I be able to join you instead of him?

- The band.

00:50:34.941 --> 00:50:37.021
The thing is, I can play the guitar pretty well too.

The new member will be provided with room and board, right?

00:50:40.312 --> 00:50:41.888
Would I be able to stay at the guesthouse...

I'm sorry, but can you let go of...

00:50:56.961 --> 00:50:59.131
People in the band scene call me a con artist,

00:50:59.432 --> 00:51:01.401
and Se Gyeong thinks I'm a failure.

00:51:04.472 --> 00:51:05.778
or hadn't followed me,

Good. He failed even sooner than I thought.

00:54:22.532 --> 00:54:24.731
Yes. Hey, what happened?

00:54:24.972 --> 00:54:26.377
Is it true that you can't start a band?

00:54:26.401 --> 00:54:28.501
- I bet my money on you, so I'm...
- Yi Chan!

00:54:28.872 --> 00:54:30.441
Ha Yi Chan!

00:54:32.242 --> 00:54:33.571
Oh, why...

00:54:33.912 --> 00:54:35.082
I love you, Jun Ki.

00:54:35.242 --> 00:54:38.282
No, Yi Chan. We can't do this.

00:54:38.552 --> 00:54:40.421
No. Wait, Yi Chan.

00:54:41.321 --> 00:54:42.821
Thank you for everything you do.

00:54:42.952 --> 00:54:44.521
My pleasure. Have a good day.

00:54:45.921 --> 00:54:46.992
- Stop.
- Wait.

00:54:48.521 --> 00:54:49.961
- Wait here.
- Yi Chan!

00:54:50.021 --> 00:54:51.908
- Ha Yi Chan!
- Hey!

00:54:51.932 --> 00:54:53.267
We need to talk.

00:54:53.291 --> 00:54:54.432
About what?

00:54:56.832 --> 00:54:58.501
(Seowon Arts High School)

00:54:58.702 --> 00:54:59.702
Okay.

00:55:03.001 --> 00:55:04.921
Hey, you. Can you throw the ball back over here?

00:55:08.441 --> 00:55:09.481
The left hand...

00:55:14.352 --> 00:55:15.329
- will only assist...
- What?

00:55:15.353 --> 00:55:16.952
That's Ha Yi Chan from Baekwang High.

00:55:17.751 --> 00:55:18.991
Who? Is he a basketball player?

00:55:19.191 --> 00:55:21.421
The name rings a bell, but...

00:55:22.821 --> 00:55:23.932
I must run.

00:55:24.691 --> 00:55:25.791
That little...

00:55:37.341 --> 00:55:38.412
Hey!

00:55:38.642 --> 00:55:39.671
Stop right there!

00:55:40.271 --> 00:55:41.758
Why is he so fast?

00:55:41.782 --> 00:55:43.582
- Catch me if you can.
- Stop right there!

00:56:44.171 --> 00:56:46.441
This little rat. Where did he go?

00:56:48.682 --> 00:56:49.782
Did he go that way?

00:56:59.952 --> 00:57:00.992
Is he here?

00:57:04.432 --> 00:57:05.432
Darn it.

00:57:19.441 --> 00:57:20.472
Where is he?

00:57:20.742 --> 00:57:22.312
I swear, I heard his voice just now.

00:57:26.952 --> 00:57:28.921
Gosh, why is he taking so long?

00:57:55.711 --> 00:57:57.041
Please stay put.

00:57:58.251 --> 00:58:01.381
I promise to repay you for your help before I die.

00:58:08.421 --> 00:58:09.421
Ma'am.

00:58:12.791 --> 00:58:13.951
Did you just call me "Ma'am?"

00:58:14.302 --> 00:58:15.731
My gosh. It really is you.

00:58:18.832 --> 00:58:21.501
I had no idea I'd run into you here, ma'am.

00:58:36.052 --> 00:58:38.791
(Special thanks to Kim Seul Gi and Kim Jun Hyung)

00:59:05.352 --> 00:59:09.981
(Twinkling Watermelon)

00:59:10.082 --> 00:59:12.727
I thought my life was always meant to shine.

00:59:12.751 --> 00:59:15.238
Was she the reason you wanted to start a band?

00:59:15.262 --> 00:59:17.098
Until I met this fool.

00:59:17.122 --> 00:59:18.107
I was immature...

00:59:18.131 --> 00:59:20.707
for thinking I should start a band because I was so in love.

00:59:20.731 --> 00:59:22.178
I'm leaving next week to go study abroad.

00:59:22.202 --> 00:59:23.361
For now, it's a secret.

00:59:23.432 --> 00:59:26.107
Why? Because of Ha Yi Chan at Baekwang High?

00:59:26.131 --> 00:59:28.417
What happened to Dad...

00:59:28.441 --> 00:59:30.348
when he was 18?

00:59:30.372 --> 00:59:31.888
Do you actually want to start a band?

00:59:31.912 --> 00:59:34.118
You just want to be popular with girls.

00:59:34.142 --> 00:59:36.187
I told you. He goes to Chuncheon National University of Education.

00:59:36.211 --> 00:59:37.852
I'm going to be his tutor.
