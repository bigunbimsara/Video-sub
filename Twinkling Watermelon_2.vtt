00:00:53.023 --> 00:00:54.023
(Staff ensured child actors' safety in the filming of this drama.)

00:00:58.722 --> 00:01:00.362
What if he doesn't show up again?

00:01:00.822 --> 00:01:02.291
We haven't seen him for two weeks.

00:01:02.292 --> 00:01:04.432
Today, he'll show up. I know it.

00:01:04.963 --> 00:01:07.572
- How can you be so sure?
- He has a pattern, you see.

00:01:07.932 --> 00:01:09.331
At a particular time of the year,

00:01:09.332 --> 00:01:11.072
he says goodbye and disappears.

00:01:11.472 --> 00:01:13.002
After that, he always returns.

00:01:14.103 --> 00:01:15.173
And today's the day.

00:01:15.872 --> 00:01:17.072
What is he, a werewolf?

00:01:17.372 --> 00:01:19.412
Does he turn into a wolf at every full moon?

00:01:19.783 --> 00:01:21.783
- The national trial exam.
- What?

00:01:22.052 --> 00:01:23.313
You mean, he's still in high school?

00:01:24.722 --> 00:01:26.722
Hey, it's been 30 minutes already. Let's just go.

00:01:28.123 --> 00:01:29.222
- Oh, look!
- My gosh.

00:01:29.893 --> 00:01:31.161
- Look!
- Oh, my.

00:01:31.162 --> 00:01:32.222
He's here.

00:01:33.192 --> 00:01:35.491
- Finally!
- We've been waiting for you.

00:01:35.492 --> 00:01:37.933
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:01:38.132 --> 00:01:40.932
- It's okay!
- Don't worry!

00:01:40.933 --> 00:01:42.101
We missed you.

00:01:42.102 --> 00:01:45.643
Sadly, I think this will be my last performance.

00:01:46.173 --> 00:01:47.772
- No!
- Whatever. You're just saying that.

00:01:48.043 --> 00:01:49.741
You always say it'll be the last performance...

00:01:49.742 --> 00:01:50.812
but always come back.

00:01:50.813 --> 00:01:52.842
Thank you for all your support.

00:01:52.843 --> 00:01:54.712
I'll remember all of you for a long time.

00:01:56.283 --> 00:01:57.351
No!

00:01:57.352 --> 00:01:59.182
He's an attention-seeker who does this...

00:01:59.183 --> 00:02:00.252
to get a reaction out of people.

00:02:00.382 --> 00:02:02.222
Those who try hard to look cool are never competent.

00:02:02.352 --> 00:02:05.123
Let's not waste our time here. Let's go. Come on.

00:03:08.753 --> 00:03:10.353
We've found a diamond in the mud.

00:03:16.663 --> 00:03:18.232
Make sure you pick up the gifts another day.

00:03:18.233 --> 00:03:19.332
Thank you for everything.

00:03:28.473 --> 00:03:30.173
Hey, you. Masked man!

00:03:46.592 --> 00:03:49.362
We're here to make you an offer you can't refuse.

00:03:49.633 --> 00:03:51.502
The Coldplay of Hongdae's indie scene, SPINE9.

00:03:51.503 --> 00:03:53.262
The band is looking for a new guitarist,

00:03:53.263 --> 00:03:55.332
and we'll give you a chance to participate in the audition.

00:03:55.573 --> 00:03:58.173
What do you say? Aren't you excited?

00:03:58.302 --> 00:03:59.841
I bet you can't turn it down...

00:03:59.842 --> 00:04:01.372
I'm sorry, but I must decline.

00:04:03.473 --> 00:04:05.282
Hey, wait.

00:04:06.312 --> 00:04:08.051
Come on, kid. Don't make such a hasty decision.

00:04:08.052 --> 00:04:09.412
We're the Coldplay of Hongdae.

00:04:09.413 --> 00:04:10.582
- I must decline.
- No.

00:04:11.223 --> 00:04:13.782
We won't take no for an answer. You can pay your way out of it.

00:04:15.622 --> 00:04:16.622
Take this.

00:04:20.393 --> 00:04:21.932
The third track is the song we'll use in the audition.

00:04:22.133 --> 00:04:23.262
Take a listen, and come up...

00:04:23.263 --> 00:04:25.002
with a guitar riff and a sub vocal melody line.

00:04:25.003 --> 00:04:27.462
If you pass the audition, you can join SPINE9.

00:04:33.743 --> 00:04:36.012
The audition will begin at 6pm on Friday.

00:04:36.013 --> 00:04:39.013
In the practice room at Club Spark, where all bands gather. Okay?

00:05:05.102 --> 00:05:06.671
All of a sudden, I was reminded of the saying...

00:05:06.672 --> 00:05:08.342
with the end-of-the-century vibe that made me cringe.

00:05:09.712 --> 00:05:13.383
"Music is the only drug allowed by the government."

00:05:40.272 --> 00:05:41.972
Will I manage to quit it this time?

00:06:29.522 --> 00:06:30.592
Can I...

00:06:31.623 --> 00:06:32.693
really quit music?

00:06:34.393 --> 00:06:35.433
Can I?

00:06:39.662 --> 00:06:42.503
I bet that jerk, Hyun Chul, left because he got a good offer.

00:06:42.602 --> 00:06:44.771
They must've made an enticing offer.

00:06:44.772 --> 00:06:45.772
So he got all excited...

00:06:45.773 --> 00:06:47.041
and ditched us, using me as an excuse.

00:06:47.042 --> 00:06:48.643
Don't be ridiculous. You're always like this.

00:06:50.412 --> 00:06:51.781
Darn. Anyway,

00:06:51.782 --> 00:06:53.942
if we want to get the team back in order and reclaim the prime slot,

00:06:53.943 --> 00:06:56.112
we must hurry up and find a talented new member who's already popular.

00:06:56.113 --> 00:06:57.383
I told you. That guy is no good.

00:06:57.582 --> 00:06:58.882
Why do you think he always wears a mask?

00:06:58.883 --> 00:07:00.882
He's not confident about the lower half of his face.

00:07:00.883 --> 00:07:02.952
Clearly, you do not have a good eye.

00:07:02.953 --> 00:07:04.091
You saw his eyes.

00:07:04.092 --> 00:07:05.992
Even with the mask on, you can tell that he's handsome.

00:07:05.993 --> 00:07:08.063
I'm sure he's handsome. I bet 50 dollars. Are you in?

00:07:10.832 --> 00:07:12.532
Is the offer still on the table?

00:07:20.003 --> 00:07:21.411
I have some conditions, though.

00:07:21.412 --> 00:07:23.812
First, I can never take the mask off due to personal reasons.

00:07:23.813 --> 00:07:25.242
Second, I'll be a high school senior next year,

00:07:25.243 --> 00:07:26.942
so I must focus on my studies at exam time.

00:07:26.943 --> 00:07:29.182
Third, I have a unique family situation,

00:07:29.183 --> 00:07:30.252
so I must put school before music,

00:07:30.253 --> 00:07:31.952
and my family will always be my top priority.

00:07:31.953 --> 00:07:33.082
Despite that...

00:07:35.852 --> 00:07:37.493
can I still join the band?

00:07:42.532 --> 00:07:44.132
What did you just say?

00:07:44.133 --> 00:07:46.162
- You'll become what?
- Choi Se Gyeong's boyfriend.

00:07:47.063 --> 00:07:48.972
You're not serious right now, are you?

00:07:50.732 --> 00:07:53.873
At first, I thought I was seeing things while daydreaming.

00:08:04.352 --> 00:08:05.852
I was like, "Or, am I dead?"

00:08:06.522 --> 00:08:07.683
"Did I just see an angel?"

00:08:08.592 --> 00:08:09.753
I thought that for a moment.

00:08:11.123 --> 00:08:12.961
But no. I was wrong.

00:08:12.962 --> 00:08:14.262
She's real.

00:08:14.263 --> 00:08:15.763
Such a beauty actually exists!

00:08:16.133 --> 00:08:18.803
Hey, brother! I need her info.

00:08:18.962 --> 00:08:20.231
You can help me, right?

00:08:20.232 --> 00:08:21.471
You're like Sherlock Holmes.

00:08:21.472 --> 00:08:23.231
You're better than the FBI when it comes to gathering Intel.

00:08:23.232 --> 00:08:25.172
Right, I don't even need to look into it. Just give up.

00:08:25.243 --> 00:08:26.902
Darn you! Why should I?

00:08:27.342 --> 00:08:29.313
"Why?"

00:08:32.782 --> 00:08:34.183
Do you want to hear the truth?

00:08:35.253 --> 00:08:37.481
Choi Se Gyeong in 11th grade at Seowon Arts High School.

00:08:37.482 --> 00:08:39.323
- She plays the cello.
- Choi Se Gyeong is here!

00:08:39.753 --> 00:08:41.721
In front of her school, you always see a crowd...

00:08:41.722 --> 00:08:43.492
of students from all-boys high schools in the area...

00:08:43.493 --> 00:08:44.992
who want to see her and people...

00:08:44.993 --> 00:08:47.262
from entertainment agencies who want to make her a superstar.

00:08:47.263 --> 00:08:49.632
I can't get you out of my mind. You, my angel...

00:08:49.633 --> 00:08:51.161
Don't you want to be like Ko So Young?

00:08:51.162 --> 00:08:53.931
It's more competitive than getting into a good college.

00:08:53.932 --> 00:08:55.332
Sorry, she doesn't have time for you.

00:08:55.333 --> 00:08:56.802
She never even shows any interest in them.

00:08:59.402 --> 00:09:00.603
She always keeps to herself.

00:09:01.272 --> 00:09:03.743
She's disciplined and extremely talented.

00:09:04.143 --> 00:09:05.213
Her schedule?

00:09:05.643 --> 00:09:07.812
She's busier than most celebrities.

00:09:08.083 --> 00:09:09.612
From school and her lessons and practice...

00:09:09.613 --> 00:09:10.811
to recitals and various social events.

00:09:10.812 --> 00:09:12.383
She has no time to spare.

00:09:12.723 --> 00:09:13.752
And her family?

00:09:13.753 --> 00:09:14.922
Gosh, she comes from a very good family.

00:09:15.753 --> 00:09:17.322
You know what a prestigious family means, right?

00:09:18.792 --> 00:09:21.262
- I know. A family of good writers?
- Wrong.

00:09:21.263 --> 00:09:22.993
Do you want to get your front teeth knocked out?

00:09:23.432 --> 00:09:24.932
Someone's not in the mood for jokes.

00:09:26.532 --> 00:09:28.373
- Fine, continue.
- Her family is very wealthy.

00:09:29.003 --> 00:09:31.071
Hey, why do you think an angel like her...

00:09:31.072 --> 00:09:33.103
descended to the human world?

00:09:33.743 --> 00:09:35.112
Even if she had to take off her wings...

00:09:35.113 --> 00:09:36.372
to descend into this realm,

00:09:36.373 --> 00:09:38.041
she could go ahead and open dozens of factories...

00:09:38.042 --> 00:09:39.942
on the land her family owns to manufacture wings.

00:09:42.312 --> 00:09:45.753
My dear daughter, are you ready for your recital today?

00:09:46.282 --> 00:09:48.021
I picked out a few dresses for you.

00:09:48.022 --> 00:09:50.452
Just for your reference, I like the pink one the best.

00:10:06.873 --> 00:10:08.473
And most importantly,

00:10:09.213 --> 00:10:10.572
she already has a boyfriend.

00:10:12.243 --> 00:10:14.282
They've already met each other's families.

00:10:14.643 --> 00:10:16.012
They're practically engaged.

00:10:16.013 --> 00:10:17.112
But I want to marry her.

00:10:17.113 --> 00:10:19.352
Goodness. I know you're smitten, but get a grip.

00:10:19.353 --> 00:10:21.451
Hey, look. He's handsome.

00:10:21.452 --> 00:10:22.552
And he's rich.

00:10:22.792 --> 00:10:24.922
On top of that, he goes to med school and is in a band.

00:10:25.493 --> 00:10:28.062
Do you seriously think you can beat a doctor-to-be?

00:10:37.172 --> 00:10:38.372
Do you think they saw us?

00:10:38.373 --> 00:10:39.572
I have no idea.

00:10:40.942 --> 00:10:42.113
Anyway, give up already.

00:10:42.442 --> 00:10:45.143
To Choi Se Gyeong, you're just a peasant.

00:10:45.843 --> 00:10:48.083
You can't dare to...

00:10:51.652 --> 00:10:53.822
Gosh, that idiot actually climbed over the wall.

00:12:21.613 --> 00:12:22.643
It is you.

00:12:23.572 --> 00:12:25.643
The part-timer at the ice cream shop.

00:12:27.383 --> 00:12:28.853
How did you get in?

00:12:29.052 --> 00:12:32.383
Well, you know. I got invited.

00:12:32.452 --> 00:12:34.483
Is that so? Who invited you?

00:12:36.393 --> 00:12:38.022
The one who organized this party?

00:12:38.393 --> 00:12:40.292
Oh! Hello.

00:12:41.062 --> 00:12:42.262
The chairman of Seowon Arts High School...

00:12:42.263 --> 00:12:43.493
organized this party,

00:12:45.032 --> 00:12:46.633
and I'm the chairman's daughter.

00:12:47.662 --> 00:12:50.902
If I remember correctly, neither of us invited you.

00:12:53.272 --> 00:12:54.272
Who are you?

00:12:55.873 --> 00:12:57.513
- Are you a thief?
- What?

00:12:58.113 --> 00:12:59.642
What do you take me for?

00:12:59.643 --> 00:13:00.983
I invited him.

00:13:02.312 --> 00:13:03.513
Se Gyeong, you invited him?

00:13:04.483 --> 00:13:05.483
Why?

00:13:05.522 --> 00:13:07.983
I didn't pay for my ice cream that day.

00:13:08.522 --> 00:13:11.022
Follow me. I don't have my wallet on me right now.

00:13:19.662 --> 00:13:21.363
Thanks a lot for your help.

00:13:21.902 --> 00:13:24.402
I didn't think you'd remember meeting me that day.

00:13:29.312 --> 00:13:30.572
How about we get on a first-name basis?

00:13:30.912 --> 00:13:32.082
I'm in 11th grade too.

00:13:32.083 --> 00:13:34.613
Don't waste your life away. You should use your time wisely.

00:13:34.883 --> 00:13:36.852
- What?
- If you keep being clingy,

00:13:36.853 --> 00:13:38.113
you'll be seen as a stalker.

00:13:38.452 --> 00:13:40.652
Stalkers are ones who failed in life.

00:13:41.353 --> 00:13:44.552
Take my sincere advice instead of the money for the ice cream.

00:13:47.363 --> 00:13:48.593
I am not a stalker.

00:13:49.633 --> 00:13:50.662
Oh, sorry.

00:13:51.393 --> 00:13:52.902
You barely know me.

00:13:53.233 --> 00:13:55.372
It takes time to become friends with...

00:13:55.373 --> 00:13:57.671
You see, I'm wearing this dress...

00:13:57.672 --> 00:14:00.473
to deliver a perfect performance in front of professors...

00:14:00.643 --> 00:14:02.171
who may teach me later on.

00:14:02.172 --> 00:14:04.343
How much time, effort, and money do you think that went into this?

00:14:04.912 --> 00:14:05.983
Is this a quiz?

00:14:06.613 --> 00:14:08.182
A day? Two days?

00:14:08.613 --> 00:14:09.912
Think about it.

00:14:09.952 --> 00:14:11.922
Do you think I've even had a moment to be distracted?

00:14:12.022 --> 00:14:13.583
And it won't be any different going forward.

00:14:13.753 --> 00:14:16.093
But you're human, not a machine.

00:14:16.152 --> 00:14:18.191
You should also play and let loose...

00:14:18.192 --> 00:14:20.963
You see, we live in different worlds.

00:14:21.292 --> 00:14:22.463
Didn't you see the people at the party?

00:14:22.692 --> 00:14:24.232
When you're busy playing,

00:14:24.233 --> 00:14:25.561
I'm busy networking.

00:14:25.562 --> 00:14:27.662
When you're building sandcastles, I'm building connections.

00:14:29.103 --> 00:14:31.272
Your life is FAH.

00:14:31.672 --> 00:14:32.672
What?

00:14:32.673 --> 00:14:35.412
Your life is frustrating as heck.

00:14:36.312 --> 00:14:39.782
You can never get back your youth.

00:14:40.383 --> 00:14:42.551
You need to let loose and have some fun here and there...

00:14:42.552 --> 00:14:44.253
- Do you like stripes?
- You mean, the soft drink?

00:14:44.583 --> 00:14:46.582
Of course, I do. Shall we go have some now?

00:14:46.583 --> 00:14:49.792
No, not that. I meant stripes.

00:14:49.952 --> 00:14:51.021
Stripes? Why do you ask?

00:14:51.022 --> 00:14:52.263
Your fly is open.

00:14:54.723 --> 00:14:55.763
My gosh.

00:14:56.733 --> 00:14:57.733
Oh, no.

00:15:17.113 --> 00:15:20.753
I'm not scared tonight

00:15:20.883 --> 00:15:26.263
No obstacles can stand in our way

00:15:26.463 --> 00:15:27.662
Anymore

00:15:27.963 --> 00:15:29.291
All right

00:15:29.292 --> 00:15:32.003
I'll tell you no matter what

00:15:32.103 --> 00:15:36.232
My heart is starting to beat

00:15:36.233 --> 00:15:39.041
- Louder now - Let's go

00:15:39.042 --> 00:15:41.642
Step one, even if I fall down

00:15:41.643 --> 00:15:45.113
Step two, I will get up twice

00:15:45.483 --> 00:15:47.142
Yes, don't stop

00:15:47.143 --> 00:15:49.383
I can fly away

00:15:49.583 --> 00:15:54.753
Keep on knocking, and when the door opens

00:15:54.983 --> 00:15:57.951
Then the story about the two of us

00:15:57.952 --> 00:16:00.622
Will unfold on this vast sea

00:16:00.623 --> 00:16:05.363
Reach out your hands, higher

00:16:05.532 --> 00:16:08.602
You can almost touch it

00:16:08.603 --> 00:16:15.243
Let's follow our dreams

00:16:33.863 --> 00:16:35.291
- As for the Yoon Dong Jin Band, - Yes.

00:16:35.292 --> 00:16:37.133
did you confirm the changes in their overseas tour schedule?

00:16:37.393 --> 00:16:40.801
The talk with the organizer for their tour in Europe went well.

00:16:40.802 --> 00:16:43.233
And we're holding off on starting ticket sales for North America.

00:16:44.532 --> 00:16:45.972
And we still haven't decided on the band...

00:16:45.973 --> 00:16:47.401
for the opening performance?

00:16:47.402 --> 00:16:49.712
I followed your suggestion and submitted a list...

00:16:49.713 --> 00:16:50.941
that mainly consisted of rookie indie bands,

00:16:50.942 --> 00:16:52.812
but Yoon Dong Jin said no to every single one of them.

00:16:55.912 --> 00:16:57.282
In 30 minutes, I'll be meeting...

00:16:57.452 --> 00:16:59.522
- with the AR and MR teams.
- Got it.

00:17:01.452 --> 00:17:02.792
Where is Yoon Dong Jin now?

00:17:08.093 --> 00:17:11.633
When the path you're on

00:17:11.932 --> 00:17:14.833
Is too exhausting

00:17:15.432 --> 00:17:18.232
And challenging

00:17:18.502 --> 00:17:21.171
Please tell me

00:17:21.172 --> 00:17:23.941
Don't hide it

00:17:23.942 --> 00:17:29.512
You're not alone

00:17:30.182 --> 00:17:33.322
Eventually

00:17:33.323 --> 00:17:36.252
Just like the blue whales

00:17:37.393 --> 00:17:40.393
We'll swim too

00:17:40.623 --> 00:17:42.332
- Without fear - That was during...

00:17:42.333 --> 00:17:44.491
- the PC communications craze.
- Right.

00:17:44.492 --> 00:17:47.402
People would freely criticize songs on online forums...

00:17:48.103 --> 00:17:50.133
and also used them to look for band members.

00:17:50.803 --> 00:17:53.902
I also joined a school band through that route.

00:17:54.303 --> 00:17:55.472
The name of the band was...

00:17:57.172 --> 00:17:59.712
First Love Memory Manipulators?

00:18:01.383 --> 00:18:02.681
Am I remembering this correctly?

00:18:02.682 --> 00:18:04.482
I'm not too sure,

00:18:04.613 --> 00:18:08.323
but people called us "The Manipulators" in short.

00:18:08.823 --> 00:18:10.092
And they weren't wrong...

00:18:10.093 --> 00:18:13.063
because we were awful.

00:18:14.222 --> 00:18:16.932
Then tell me about the time when you first met the band members.

00:18:17.093 --> 00:18:18.563
It was embarrassing.

00:18:19.402 --> 00:18:21.401
Back then, we had to tell each other to stand somewhere in Hongdae...

00:18:21.402 --> 00:18:23.132
holding a school magazine in the right hand...

00:18:23.133 --> 00:18:24.533
in order to recognize each other when we met.

00:18:24.873 --> 00:18:26.072
So that was when you met...

00:18:26.073 --> 00:18:27.902
Mr. Oh Ma Joo for the first time, right?

00:18:27.942 --> 00:18:30.972
That's right. I can't believe it's been 29 years already.

00:18:31.073 --> 00:18:33.142
Then are any of the other co-members still working...

00:18:33.143 --> 00:18:34.842
in the music industry?

00:18:34.843 --> 00:18:37.712
- No one. I'm the only one.
- My gosh.

00:18:38.682 --> 00:18:40.882
Unfortunately, we had to disband after a short while...

00:18:40.883 --> 00:18:42.752
because one of the members caused big trouble.

00:18:43.922 --> 00:18:47.122
Sir, I think I've discovered a hidden gem.

00:18:47.123 --> 00:18:48.422
You need to see this.

00:18:48.692 --> 00:18:50.563
Here, this guy with the mask.

00:18:52.633 --> 00:18:54.103
Isn't he such an amazing guitarist?

00:18:54.502 --> 00:18:56.732
He's a sub-vocalist, so he doesn't have many parts.

00:18:57.172 --> 00:18:58.471
But he has a unique voice.

00:18:58.472 --> 00:19:00.572
And as you can see, he's tall and fit.

00:19:00.573 --> 00:19:02.172
I think he's got a nice face too.

00:19:02.373 --> 00:19:03.373
What do you think?

00:19:03.912 --> 00:19:05.412
Is this mask his styling concept?

00:19:05.682 --> 00:19:07.542
Well, don't you think it's a cool marketing tactic?

00:19:07.543 --> 00:19:09.482
It makes you want to take it off.

00:19:14.752 --> 00:19:16.421
My gosh. They're already here.

00:19:16.422 --> 00:19:18.323
- Can I get your autograph?
- Let us through.

00:19:18.492 --> 00:19:20.322
- Sorry. Coming through.
- Over here!

00:19:20.323 --> 00:19:21.691
- Sorry.
- Can I get your autograph?

00:19:21.692 --> 00:19:23.991
- Hey, let's go.
- Come on, quick.

00:19:23.992 --> 00:19:25.262
Hey, go.

00:19:25.563 --> 00:19:26.563
Thank you.

00:19:28.773 --> 00:19:30.472
- Gosh.
- Oh, boy.

00:19:30.633 --> 00:19:31.932
My gosh. I'm so frazzled.

00:19:32.303 --> 00:19:33.472
I nearly died.

00:19:33.672 --> 00:19:35.102
I could barely breathe, wearing the mask.

00:19:35.103 --> 00:19:36.573
You're our lucky charm!

00:19:36.672 --> 00:19:39.582
Gosh. If people see his face, they'll go wild.

00:19:39.583 --> 00:19:41.112
Gosh, it's such a shame.

00:19:41.113 --> 00:19:42.152
Hey, leave him be.

00:19:42.553 --> 00:19:45.052
When the masked singer takes off his mask, it's game over.

00:19:45.053 --> 00:19:46.553
It's time you took it off.

00:19:46.623 --> 00:19:48.752
We have a truckload of masks from your fans.

00:19:49.353 --> 00:19:51.421
Why don't you just wear gold grills like rappers do?

00:19:51.422 --> 00:19:52.692
Then we'll get some gold bars at least.

00:19:52.793 --> 00:19:54.563
I have good news and bad news.

00:19:55.393 --> 00:19:56.633
Which one do you want to hear first?

00:19:56.932 --> 00:19:59.432
Gosh, I really hate it when you say that.

00:19:59.762 --> 00:20:00.762
You make me feel like...

00:20:00.763 --> 00:20:02.033
I'm the most indecisive person in the world.

00:20:02.502 --> 00:20:05.471
Well, they say bad things happen before good things.

00:20:05.472 --> 00:20:06.672
Let's just get it over with.

00:20:06.972 --> 00:20:08.002
Tell us the bad news first.

00:20:08.603 --> 00:20:09.613
I think it's about time...

00:20:10.512 --> 00:20:12.282
we parted ways.

00:20:12.283 --> 00:20:13.843
What? What are you talking about?

00:20:14.283 --> 00:20:16.053
Are you ditching us?

00:20:16.113 --> 00:20:18.412
You were all excited when you said your sales soared thanks to us.

00:20:18.682 --> 00:20:20.552
Then what's the good news?

00:20:20.553 --> 00:20:22.921
I just got a call from MJ Entertainment.

00:20:22.922 --> 00:20:24.623
They're looking for a band that could tag along...

00:20:24.823 --> 00:20:27.161
on Yoon Dong Jin's concert tour overseas.

00:20:27.162 --> 00:20:28.222
Okay, and?

00:20:29.162 --> 00:20:33.133
SPINE9 is on the list!

00:20:35.162 --> 00:20:37.833
Next week, Mr. Oh Ma Joo...

00:20:38.033 --> 00:20:40.102
will come here...

00:20:40.103 --> 00:20:42.942
to watch you guys perform in person!

00:20:43.113 --> 00:20:45.172
- My gosh!
- Yes!

00:20:47.843 --> 00:20:51.681
Keep on knocking, and when the door opens

00:20:51.682 --> 00:20:54.182
Wait. But who's Oh Ma Joo?

00:20:55.692 --> 00:20:57.552
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

00:20:57.553 --> 00:20:58.823
- Yes!
- Yes!

00:21:03.732 --> 00:21:05.532
Hey, you're in a band.

00:21:05.533 --> 00:21:06.732
How could you not know who Oh Ma Joo is?

00:21:07.563 --> 00:21:08.772
You know who Yoon Dong Jin is, right?

00:21:08.773 --> 00:21:09.802
Of course, I do.

00:21:09.803 --> 00:21:11.432
He's the godfather of Korean band music.

00:21:12.402 --> 00:21:14.842
Oh Ma Joo is the one who helped Yoon Dong Jin...

00:21:14.843 --> 00:21:16.671
become the number one artist in the country.

00:21:16.672 --> 00:21:18.911
Oh Ma Joo has been his manager since he was a nobody.

00:21:18.912 --> 00:21:21.112
And he's known to have the Midas touch.

00:21:21.113 --> 00:21:23.751
Whatever he works on becomes a huge hit,

00:21:23.752 --> 00:21:25.211
be it a song, an album, or an artist.

00:21:25.212 --> 00:21:28.823
That's right. If Oh Ma Joo picks us,

00:21:28.992 --> 00:21:31.092
we'll join Yoon Dong Jin on his concert tour overseas,

00:21:31.093 --> 00:21:33.421
and we can work with the best of the best...

00:21:33.422 --> 00:21:34.792
in a top-of-the-line facility.

00:21:34.793 --> 00:21:37.192
In other words, we can release a real album.

00:21:39.033 --> 00:21:40.231
Hey, kiddo.

00:21:40.232 --> 00:21:42.333
Do you now understand what an amazing opportunity this is?

00:21:42.402 --> 00:21:45.501
My gosh. This is so cool!

00:21:45.502 --> 00:21:46.901
Let's celebrate, guys. Cheers!

00:21:46.902 --> 00:21:49.172
- Cheers!
- Cheers.

00:21:52.883 --> 00:21:54.242
I got into an accident.

00:21:54.412 --> 00:21:56.052
Come to the Seogyo Police Station as soon as you can.

00:21:56.053 --> 00:21:57.912
Sorry, something's come up. I have to go.

00:21:58.613 --> 00:22:00.952
- Hey.
- He's doing this again.

00:22:01.182 --> 00:22:03.691
Why does he have so many secrets?

00:22:03.692 --> 00:22:04.853
(Seogyo Police Station)

00:22:09.133 --> 00:22:11.462
I told you. I was the one who drove!

00:22:12.662 --> 00:22:14.931
My heart was pounding like crazy,

00:22:14.932 --> 00:22:17.731
so I got out of the car and left the scene for a bit.

00:22:17.732 --> 00:22:20.202
But as you can see, I voluntarily came here.

00:22:20.643 --> 00:22:23.211
Ma'am, please don't lie.

00:22:23.212 --> 00:22:24.842
You did not come here voluntarily.

00:22:24.843 --> 00:22:27.113
We ran your plate and called you here.

00:22:27.583 --> 00:22:29.181
This is clearly a hit-and-run case.

00:22:29.182 --> 00:22:31.251
Right, I told you that I'd pay for what I did.

00:22:31.252 --> 00:22:33.052
The damaged goods and the medical expenses.

00:22:33.053 --> 00:22:34.721
I'll compensate him for everything.

00:22:34.722 --> 00:22:36.793
So what is the problem?

00:22:36.853 --> 00:22:38.862
He said the driver was someone else.

00:22:38.863 --> 00:22:41.363
It's my car. Who'd drive it if not me?

00:22:43.333 --> 00:22:45.261
I swear, she wasn't the driver.

00:22:45.262 --> 00:22:46.932
It was someone else. I'm sure of it.

00:22:53.873 --> 00:22:55.773
Are you all right? Are you hurt?

00:22:56.043 --> 00:22:57.971
I'm fine. I tripped and fell...

00:22:57.972 --> 00:22:59.613
while trying to avoid getting hit by the car. Look, here.

00:23:03.252 --> 00:23:04.382
I heard it was a car accident.

00:23:04.383 --> 00:23:06.122
What exactly happened?

00:23:06.123 --> 00:23:08.681
Is my dad the victim, or did he cause the accident?

00:23:08.682 --> 00:23:10.123
Have you checked the security footage?

00:23:10.353 --> 00:23:12.922
This lady's car crashed into your father's warehouse.

00:23:13.123 --> 00:23:14.892
But the security cameras at the scene were broken,

00:23:14.893 --> 00:23:17.262
so we have yet to confirm who the hit-and-run driver is.

00:23:17.793 --> 00:23:19.701
This lady is saying it was her,

00:23:19.702 --> 00:23:22.202
but I think your father keeps saying it wasn't her.

00:23:23.033 --> 00:23:25.472
- Could you ask him for me?
- Sure.

00:23:27.643 --> 00:23:29.073
Did you see the driver?

00:23:32.482 --> 00:23:34.543
My father clearly saw the driver with his own two eyes.

00:23:34.942 --> 00:23:37.853
The driver who ran away wasn't her. It was a guy.

00:23:43.752 --> 00:23:45.452
Why? What did he say?

00:23:47.823 --> 00:23:48.863
Are you sure?

00:23:49.093 --> 00:23:51.563
I clearly saw him with my own two eyes.

00:23:59.603 --> 00:24:01.402
He's sure the driver who ran away...

00:24:04.172 --> 00:24:06.343
- was this lady's son.
- Hey!

00:24:06.813 --> 00:24:09.251
How dare you try to dump this on my son?

00:24:09.252 --> 00:24:10.883
Please be quiet!

00:24:11.182 --> 00:24:14.323
It's not true. I swear I was the one who drove.

00:24:14.982 --> 00:24:17.022
It was a dark alleyway without a single street light.

00:24:17.023 --> 00:24:19.823
How could he have seen the driver's face?

00:24:19.992 --> 00:24:23.063
He's doing this to mess with me!

00:24:29.833 --> 00:24:32.103
- Thank you.
- No problem.

00:24:32.303 --> 00:24:33.942
Thanks for being your father's interpreter.

00:24:35.303 --> 00:24:37.573
We'll be in touch once we find solid evidence.

00:24:38.343 --> 00:24:40.212
- You said you were in 11th grade.
- Yes.

00:24:40.482 --> 00:24:41.981
For your father's sake,

00:24:41.982 --> 00:24:44.712
you should study hard and try not to be distracted. Okay?

00:24:50.323 --> 00:24:52.293
Eun Gyeol!

00:24:52.523 --> 00:24:55.322
What on earth is your dad saying?

00:24:55.323 --> 00:24:57.093
(Hardworking Seogyo Police, Safe City for Happy Citizens)

00:24:57.992 --> 00:25:01.202
He won't let me leave. What is this?

00:25:01.363 --> 00:25:02.432
My gosh.

00:25:04.172 --> 00:25:06.342
He says you must be worried about Byung Ho.

00:25:06.343 --> 00:25:07.543
Is he trying to provoke me?

00:25:13.942 --> 00:25:17.583
"Ma'am, you haven't changed at all."

00:25:19.583 --> 00:25:20.682
What's with the pause?

00:25:27.192 --> 00:25:28.192
What is it?

00:25:28.722 --> 00:25:30.192
What's he saying?

00:25:38.002 --> 00:25:40.342
Tell me. What did your dad say?

00:25:40.343 --> 00:25:42.373
Tell me everything. Don't leave a single word out!

00:25:44.012 --> 00:25:46.543
"Ma'am, you haven't changed at all."

00:25:49.583 --> 00:25:50.652
"Even the day..."

00:25:51.583 --> 00:25:54.023
"when the fire broke out at my house six years ago,"

00:25:55.252 --> 00:25:57.293
"you pretended not to know the truth."

00:25:58.293 --> 00:25:59.761
Go ahead and sue me...

00:25:59.762 --> 00:26:01.592
for violating the Housing Lease Protection Act...

00:26:01.593 --> 00:26:03.092
or stage a one-man protest if you want to. I don't care.

00:26:03.093 --> 00:26:04.592
I want you to move out at once.

00:26:04.593 --> 00:26:06.962
"You held us accountable for everything when we did nothing."

00:26:08.363 --> 00:26:09.732
"It's your own fault..."

00:26:11.373 --> 00:26:12.742
"that Byung Ho turned out like this."

00:26:15.273 --> 00:26:16.313
That's what he said.

00:26:16.773 --> 00:26:17.843
What?

00:26:20.212 --> 00:26:21.912
What did my son do?

00:26:22.553 --> 00:26:24.383
There's nothing wrong with my son!

00:26:35.093 --> 00:26:37.533
(To Die For Chicken)

00:27:17.702 --> 00:27:20.103
Sorry for calling you out of the blue today.

00:27:20.902 --> 00:27:24.112
The interpreter was running late because something had come up,

00:27:24.113 --> 00:27:25.273
so I had no choice but to call you.

00:27:26.482 --> 00:27:28.912
Couldn't you just let it go and let them off quietly?

00:27:32.752 --> 00:27:34.323
It's not like you suffered serious damage.

00:27:35.323 --> 00:27:38.023
She said she'd compensate you for all the goods and medical expenses.

00:27:50.002 --> 00:27:52.603
Then what? Should I not have said anything like six years ago?

00:27:53.902 --> 00:27:55.343
Because I can't speak,

00:27:55.803 --> 00:27:57.941
and people wouldn't care to listen to what I have to say?

00:27:57.942 --> 00:27:59.181
Because no one would listen...

00:27:59.182 --> 00:28:01.241
to those with no power and people with disabilities,

00:28:01.242 --> 00:28:03.313
should I have just stayed quiet, like I did back then?

00:28:10.353 --> 00:28:12.523
Did Byung Ho become happy because we kept it to ourselves?

00:28:12.722 --> 00:28:14.792
Were we happy that we chose to suffer without speaking out?

00:28:14.793 --> 00:28:16.192
It didn't make me happy.

00:28:18.432 --> 00:28:19.702
I felt like I owed you and Eun Ho an apology.

00:28:20.863 --> 00:28:21.961
"I should've fought."

00:28:21.962 --> 00:28:23.772
"I should have yelled and said my boys didn't cause the fire."

00:28:23.773 --> 00:28:26.103
"I shouldn't have stayed quiet." I regretted it over and over.

00:28:27.273 --> 00:28:28.942
From now on, I won't do anything I'll regret later.

00:28:29.773 --> 00:28:33.383
For the family's sake and for Byung Ho too.

00:28:52.732 --> 00:28:54.701
"I'm out. You guys go for it?"

00:28:54.702 --> 00:28:57.132
Hey, Eun Gyeol never worded it like that.

00:28:57.133 --> 00:28:59.103
He said he couldn't do it with us due to personal reasons.

00:28:59.303 --> 00:29:01.171
What are you, an AI bot?

00:29:01.172 --> 00:29:02.942
He sounded so arrogant.

00:29:05.942 --> 00:29:07.113
Let me ask you this.

00:29:07.843 --> 00:29:09.612
What are the so-called personal reasons?

00:29:09.613 --> 00:29:11.113
Like I said in the past,

00:29:11.412 --> 00:29:12.752
I must put school before music,

00:29:13.452 --> 00:29:15.022
and my family will always be my top priority.

00:29:15.023 --> 00:29:17.422
So? You've decided to choose your family over us?

00:29:17.692 --> 00:29:18.722
Yes.

00:29:19.023 --> 00:29:20.063
Why?

00:29:20.262 --> 00:29:22.462
Is your dad giving you some assets on the day of the performance?

00:29:22.932 --> 00:29:24.262
You have to be there, or he'll take it back?

00:29:25.662 --> 00:29:26.961
Then you'll be okay with me not performing?

00:29:26.962 --> 00:29:28.501
You little...

00:29:28.502 --> 00:29:30.102
Hey! Have you lost your mind?

00:29:30.103 --> 00:29:31.971
Do you think no one's above you because you're popular?

00:29:31.972 --> 00:29:33.972
I told you guys that I never liked him from the get-go!

00:29:34.103 --> 00:29:35.803
He's serious about doing music? As if.

00:29:36.543 --> 00:29:38.512
He played us and used us.

00:29:38.873 --> 00:29:40.711
To become popular with girls...

00:29:40.712 --> 00:29:42.212
and relieve stress from studying.

00:29:42.412 --> 00:29:44.411
He used us.

00:29:44.412 --> 00:29:45.512
Stop, that's enough.

00:29:45.652 --> 00:29:47.053
Who are you to play us?

00:29:47.523 --> 00:29:50.322
Oh. "See if you guys can pull it off without me."

00:29:50.323 --> 00:29:51.422
Are you messing with us?

00:29:51.623 --> 00:29:53.092
Were you waiting for the perfect moment to ruin things?

00:29:53.093 --> 00:29:54.093
Drop it.

00:29:54.094 --> 00:29:56.191
Who are you to ruin everything for us?

00:29:56.192 --> 00:29:58.332
- Who do you think you are?
- Hey, that's enough!

00:29:58.333 --> 00:29:59.402
- Drop it!
- Guys!

00:30:02.502 --> 00:30:04.402
I nearly got my family killed in the past.

00:30:06.303 --> 00:30:08.303
I was so preoccupied with music...

00:30:09.412 --> 00:30:13.242
that I neglected my brother who couldn't hear or shout for help.

00:30:14.613 --> 00:30:16.053
I was having a great time and cared about nothing else.

00:30:17.952 --> 00:30:19.383
My family never talked about it,

00:30:20.652 --> 00:30:22.283
so I thought they'd forgotten all about it,

00:30:24.023 --> 00:30:26.123
which was why I was starting to feel like I could finally breathe now,

00:30:28.293 --> 00:30:29.492
but I was wrong.

00:30:33.533 --> 00:30:35.662
It's become a deep scar.

00:30:38.402 --> 00:30:40.303
It wasn't forgotten. It's become a forbidden topic.

00:30:47.012 --> 00:30:49.712
So I must return to where I belong before it gets too late.

00:30:50.752 --> 00:30:52.512
I'll endanger my family if I start enjoying this more.

00:30:53.652 --> 00:30:54.952
Thanks for everything.

00:31:09.732 --> 00:31:11.232
Do you have to ditch us now, of all times?

00:31:20.043 --> 00:31:21.511
Before you ruin our livelihood,

00:31:21.512 --> 00:31:23.512
shouldn't you consider distancing your family first?

00:31:24.083 --> 00:31:26.012
You're 18. You're old enough now.

00:31:28.922 --> 00:31:30.093
I'm sorry.

00:31:32.823 --> 00:31:33.992
We're going to do it.

00:31:34.093 --> 00:31:35.793
Even without you, we must do it. However...

00:31:40.162 --> 00:31:41.462
We'll wait for you, just this once.

00:31:59.252 --> 00:32:01.222

Your homeroom teacher called me.

00:32:25.773 --> 00:32:27.442
I heard your grades had dropped significantly.

00:32:30.353 --> 00:32:31.812
Did you go through my room?

00:32:31.813 --> 00:32:33.783
Why? You never did this before.

00:32:34.152 --> 00:32:37.323
To be honest, this wasn't my first time visiting the study room.

00:32:37.692 --> 00:32:39.462
I've visited a few times to bring you snacks.

00:32:39.492 --> 00:32:41.222
But you weren't at your desk.

00:32:44.732 --> 00:32:45.962
I won't ask you...

00:32:46.432 --> 00:32:48.732
why you're keeping secrets from me...

00:32:49.533 --> 00:32:51.702
and how you got that scar.

00:32:52.002 --> 00:32:54.043
I want to know, but I won't ask.

00:32:54.502 --> 00:32:56.712
I'll just wait until you tell me.

00:33:01.412 --> 00:33:04.553
But I don't want your dad to find out.

00:33:05.952 --> 00:33:09.553
I want your dad to become much happier than he is now.

00:33:09.722 --> 00:33:12.392
The thing is, you're his joy.

00:33:12.393 --> 00:33:14.393
You are his pride.

00:33:20.702 --> 00:33:22.232
You'll come back, right?

00:33:22.902 --> 00:33:24.573
Very soon, you'll stop being confused...

00:33:24.732 --> 00:33:26.502
and return to being the Eun Gyeol I used to know, right?

- Do you like my daughter too?
- Pardon me?

00:35:50.853 --> 00:35:52.112
No, that's not why I'm here.

00:35:53.782 --> 00:35:57.322
There was a musical instrument shop called Viva Music right here.

00:35:58.253 --> 00:36:00.123
- Viva Music?
- Yes.

00:36:00.423 --> 00:36:02.862
The owner and I were close, so I used to visit often.

00:36:04.893 --> 00:36:06.632
I'm sorry if I made you uncomfortable.

00:36:07.063 --> 00:36:09.302

Ha Eun Gyeol, by any chance?

00:36:16.173 --> 00:36:17.742
How do you know my name?

00:36:27.653 --> 00:36:30.693
(Viva Music)

00:36:43.873 --> 00:36:45.032
You've grown up to be a fine young man.

00:36:46.302 --> 00:36:47.503
Do you want to come in for a moment?

00:36:47.673 --> 00:36:48.972
I have something to give you.

00:37:15.162 --> 00:37:16.202
She's good, isn't she?

00:37:17.873 --> 00:37:20.003
She's my daughter. She wants to be a cellist.

00:37:20.202 --> 00:37:21.603
She's 18 too, just like you.

00:37:21.673 --> 00:37:22.702
I see.

00:37:25.313 --> 00:37:27.012
And she's rebellious like most 18-year-olds.

00:37:28.742 --> 00:37:30.912
Her poor cello has to put up with that.

00:37:36.952 --> 00:37:39.123
If you don't mind me asking,

00:37:39.293 --> 00:37:42.423
how did you know Mr. Viva?

00:37:43.492 --> 00:37:44.492
I'm his daughter.

00:37:45.333 --> 00:37:47.333
I didn't know he had a daughter.

00:37:48.603 --> 00:37:49.802
Of course, you didn't know.

00:37:50.773 --> 00:37:52.431
I moved to the US in 11th grade to study abroad...

00:37:52.432 --> 00:37:54.043
and stayed there...

00:37:54.443 --> 00:37:56.103
until I heard he'd passed away.

00:38:00.912 --> 00:38:01.943
Open it.

00:38:02.342 --> 00:38:04.112
He left it behind for you.

00:38:22.603 --> 00:38:24.173
If I think it sounds good enough,

00:38:25.032 --> 00:38:27.702
I'll give you that guitar. I know you want it.

00:38:28.043 --> 00:38:29.072
Really?

00:38:29.572 --> 00:38:31.043
Are you really going to give me that guitar?

00:38:31.773 --> 00:38:34.042
I said, "If I think it sounds good enough."

00:38:34.043 --> 00:38:36.282
I clearly said that.

00:38:37.112 --> 00:38:39.353
I waited six years to give you this.

00:38:40.822 --> 00:38:43.123
I've been taking good care of it,

00:38:44.123 --> 00:38:45.992
so you can play it right away without having to tune it.

00:38:47.092 --> 00:38:48.762
I don't know how the two of you met...

00:38:49.222 --> 00:38:51.432
and how you became close,

00:38:52.262 --> 00:38:53.801
but what he said about you...

00:38:53.802 --> 00:38:56.103
to his lawyer was pretty cool.

00:38:58.472 --> 00:38:59.733
Are you ready to hear it?

00:39:01.943 --> 00:39:02.972
Yes.

00:39:05.313 --> 00:39:06.341
"That kid..."

00:39:06.342 --> 00:39:09.882
That kid knows how to talk to the guitar...

00:39:10.583 --> 00:39:13.083
and how to talk to the world through his guitar.

00:39:14.322 --> 00:39:15.623
He is...

00:39:16.322 --> 00:39:18.253
the most talented guitarist I've ever met.

00:39:44.653 --> 00:39:45.882
Do you like it?

00:40:04.273 --> 00:40:06.472
You said you would check my homework before giving it to me.

00:40:07.673 --> 00:40:09.173
I was going to give it to you anyway.

00:40:10.412 --> 00:40:11.873
You act like you're harsh.

00:40:12.112 --> 00:40:14.583
But you always prepare carrots first before whipping the horse.

00:40:14.813 --> 00:40:15.881
You received a carrot.

00:40:15.882 --> 00:40:17.653
Why do you look like you were whipped?

00:40:18.083 --> 00:40:20.182
Because I think I got homework that is more difficult.

00:40:21.722 --> 00:40:22.753
Homework?

00:40:22.952 --> 00:40:26.052
I gave up performing, which I was crazy for.

00:40:27.123 --> 00:40:28.963
It was such a tough decision.

00:40:29.662 --> 00:40:31.362
And now you're making me contemplate again.

00:40:31.592 --> 00:40:33.531
Why do you make things so complicated?

00:40:33.532 --> 00:40:35.202
Because my life is at stake.

00:40:40.103 --> 00:40:41.403
What's the right answer?

00:40:42.802 --> 00:40:44.842
Living a life that makes my heart beat.

00:40:45.943 --> 00:40:48.043
Living a life as a trophy for my father.

00:40:49.382 --> 00:40:51.012
Whichever I choose,

00:40:52.253 --> 00:40:54.923
my heart aches because of the other option I didn't choose.

00:40:57.222 --> 00:40:58.423
I'm not happy.

00:40:59.123 --> 00:41:00.692
You could flip a coin.

00:41:00.693 --> 00:41:03.123
How can you decide on your life with a coin?

00:41:03.293 --> 00:41:05.563
You're an artist. You should know what a metaphor is.

00:41:06.293 --> 00:41:09.802
Think of the stage as your coin and flip it.

00:41:42.903 --> 00:41:44.772
You wanted to break down the beats and raise the tempo.

00:41:44.773 --> 00:41:46.741
Why are you making me put out a fire?

00:41:46.742 --> 00:41:47.942
You're too fast.

00:41:47.943 --> 00:41:49.503
Do you put out a fire when you're not even ready?

00:41:51.173 --> 00:41:54.043
Hey, kiddo, increase the output drive.

00:42:23.713 --> 00:42:25.773
- Do you want to amp it up?
- What?

00:42:28.583 --> 00:42:29.583
Yes.

00:42:37.123 --> 00:42:38.123
Shall we start from the verse?

00:42:57.543 --> 00:43:01.281
I'm not scared tonight

00:43:01.282 --> 00:43:06.752
No obstacles can stand in our way

00:43:06.753 --> 00:43:07.952
Anymore

00:43:08.353 --> 00:43:09.552
All right

00:43:09.822 --> 00:43:12.222
I'll tell you no matter what

00:43:23.063 --> 00:43:26.273
Your fly is open.

00:43:27.572 --> 00:43:28.873
Your fly is open.

00:43:32.612 --> 00:43:34.942
How embarrassing.

00:43:34.943 --> 00:43:36.012
I'm done for.

00:43:36.813 --> 00:43:37.952
My goodness.

00:43:43.452 --> 00:43:44.753
Seriously.

00:43:47.423 --> 00:43:49.063
Bring it on. Let's fight.

00:43:49.722 --> 00:43:50.793
My gosh.

00:43:55.532 --> 00:43:59.532
I cried so much

00:44:00.873 --> 00:44:05.072
In the rain

00:44:06.443 --> 00:44:10.713
In the snow

00:44:11.382 --> 00:44:16.182
You were in the rain

00:44:16.623 --> 00:44:17.623
Hey.

00:44:17.822 --> 00:44:21.293
I faintly remember

00:44:21.492 --> 00:44:23.091
Bal San.

00:44:23.092 --> 00:44:26.563
Our last words

00:44:27.032 --> 00:44:28.063
Hey.

00:44:28.362 --> 00:44:30.632
Your last word

00:44:31.403 --> 00:44:32.472
Bal San.

00:44:33.103 --> 00:44:34.702
What's the name of this song?

00:44:34.903 --> 00:44:37.572
Oh, you're Yi Chan.

00:44:38.072 --> 00:44:40.543
Can you put my hair back down?

00:44:46.313 --> 00:44:47.322
This song is called...

00:44:48.253 --> 00:44:52.423
"The Story of You and the Rain" by Boohwal.

00:44:56.322 --> 00:44:59.432
You who looked sad that day

00:45:01.563 --> 00:45:04.333
I couldn't dare see you

00:45:07.373 --> 00:45:11.012
I cried so much

00:45:12.813 --> 00:45:16.342
In the rain

00:45:18.083 --> 00:45:21.322
In the snow

00:45:23.952 --> 00:45:24.952
It goes like this.

00:45:26.193 --> 00:45:29.423
Yi Chan, you must be in love.

00:45:31.563 --> 00:45:32.563
But I...

00:45:36.432 --> 00:45:37.503
have...

00:45:39.572 --> 00:45:40.872
nothing.

00:45:40.873 --> 00:45:42.443
You should be in a band then.

00:45:43.202 --> 00:45:45.643
They worship guys in a band.

00:45:46.173 --> 00:45:49.583
Kurt Cobain proved it himself.

00:45:50.483 --> 00:45:51.781
Who is that?

00:45:51.782 --> 00:45:53.253
Just know that he exists.

00:45:54.083 --> 00:45:56.023
The only way...

00:45:56.382 --> 00:45:58.022
for the poor and the powerless...

00:45:58.023 --> 00:46:00.862
can conquer the world and win fair ladies...

00:46:01.423 --> 00:46:03.063
is to join a band.

00:46:04.463 --> 00:46:05.591
A band?

00:46:05.592 --> 00:46:06.932
Do you like bands?

00:46:07.302 --> 00:46:09.362
Not a bit. They make noise pollution.

00:46:09.563 --> 00:46:11.071
And you're going to a band concert?

00:46:11.072 --> 00:46:13.302
It's Ji Hwan's regular concert with his band club members.

00:46:13.532 --> 00:46:14.742
He needs flowers.

00:46:15.373 --> 00:46:16.571
Can I join you?

00:46:16.572 --> 00:46:18.642
I love bands.

00:46:18.643 --> 00:46:20.682
No, you love medical students.

00:46:20.943 --> 00:46:22.841
Don't be like that. Let's go together, Se Gyeong.

00:46:22.842 --> 00:46:23.951
If you get me an invitation,

00:46:23.952 --> 00:46:25.853
I'll prepare the flowers. How about that?

00:46:40.702 --> 00:46:43.673
I'll prepare a bouquet as big as this.

00:46:44.432 --> 00:46:45.902
Just get a bouquet then.

00:46:45.903 --> 00:46:48.342
No, I can't. I need to make it straight.

00:47:04.793 --> 00:47:06.952
Are you okay? Your uniform is ruined.

00:47:07.963 --> 00:47:09.963
Hey, are you out of your mind?

00:47:14.802 --> 00:47:15.833
Are you all right?

00:47:27.682 --> 00:47:30.182
I'm fine. I'm going home anyway.

00:47:33.983 --> 00:47:35.583
Hey, you should apologize properly.

00:47:40.762 --> 00:47:42.423
She thinks she's better than us.

00:47:53.302 --> 00:47:54.572
It's all wet.

00:48:04.112 --> 00:48:05.282
Thank you.

00:48:06.112 --> 00:48:08.523
I'll wash it before returning it to you.

00:48:08.782 --> 00:48:10.452
You're Yoon Chung Ah who studies art, aren't you?

00:48:12.193 --> 00:48:13.722
Wait...

00:48:25.503 --> 00:48:26.503
- Se Gyeong.
- It's Se Gyeong.

00:48:26.504 --> 00:48:28.741
- It's Se Gyeong.
- It's Se Gyeong.

00:48:28.742 --> 00:48:30.071
- Se Gyeong.
- Se Gyeong.

00:48:30.072 --> 00:48:31.742
- It's Se Gyeong.
- What's going on?

00:48:32.242 --> 00:48:34.812
My gosh. Why is he not here?

00:48:34.813 --> 00:48:35.942
It's really Se Gyeong.

00:48:35.943 --> 00:48:37.583
- Yes.
- What is she wearing?

00:48:42.253 --> 00:48:44.192
- Is it really...
- What is it?

00:48:44.193 --> 00:48:45.951
- What's going on?
- Who is that guy?

00:48:45.952 --> 00:48:47.693
- What are they doing?
- What's going on?

00:48:48.463 --> 00:48:50.023
I guess you like bands as well.

00:48:50.963 --> 00:48:52.492
You should've told me.

00:48:53.193 --> 00:48:54.233
Actually,

00:48:56.762 --> 00:48:57.833
I'm in a band too.

00:48:58.072 --> 00:48:59.301
They're a thing, right?

00:48:59.302 --> 00:49:01.301
- Right?
- Are they dating?

00:49:01.302 --> 00:49:02.342
Se Gyeong.

00:49:03.242 --> 00:49:05.572
Do you want to come to our concert later?

00:49:13.083 --> 00:49:14.123
Where did you say we were going?

00:49:20.492 --> 00:49:21.762
Where did you say we were going today?

00:49:24.563 --> 00:49:25.862
To get the dashcam footage.

00:49:28.802 --> 00:49:31.503
He found a car that was at the scene on the day of the accident.

00:49:35.373 --> 00:49:37.813
I'm going to ask the owner to show us the dashcam footage.

00:49:38.972 --> 00:49:42.012
Having you there to interpret for me will be very helpful.

00:49:47.623 --> 00:49:48.653
I...

00:49:50.322 --> 00:49:51.322
have...

00:49:54.162 --> 00:49:56.523
Actually, I have an important...

00:50:02.603 --> 00:50:05.373
No! Eun Gyeol has an important meeting today.

00:50:06.072 --> 00:50:08.043
He and I are meeting my coach today...

00:50:09.342 --> 00:50:10.713
to sort out the schedule for my off-season training.

00:50:11.512 --> 00:50:13.341
Eun Gyeol has to study.

00:50:13.342 --> 00:50:14.582
I'll go instead of him.

00:50:14.583 --> 00:50:15.642
No.

00:50:15.643 --> 00:50:17.813
Coach needs to interact with someone who can hear too.

00:50:17.952 --> 00:50:19.813
Besides, he loves Eun Gyeol.

00:50:20.153 --> 00:50:22.523
So you can go there with your interpreter.

00:50:36.963 --> 00:50:38.103
Did you know?

00:50:38.603 --> 00:50:39.673
Of course.

00:50:40.173 --> 00:50:41.202
How?

00:50:48.282 --> 00:50:49.912
(Posts)

00:50:50.753 --> 00:50:52.952
(Club Spark's representative band!)

00:50:58.722 --> 00:51:00.693
I'm popular on social media.

00:51:02.362 --> 00:51:03.992
I have over 2,000 followers now.

00:51:06.693 --> 00:51:07.733
Do you want to come too?

00:51:08.162 --> 00:51:09.531
Bring your girlfriend.

00:51:09.532 --> 00:51:10.802
I'll give you invitation tickets.

00:51:11.833 --> 00:51:14.202
It's fine. I can't hear anything anyway.

00:51:16.342 --> 00:51:17.342
You little...

00:51:32.023 --> 00:51:33.092
Hello.

00:51:35.822 --> 00:51:36.893
Are you sick?

00:51:37.063 --> 00:51:38.592
I'm all right.

00:51:39.563 --> 00:51:40.632
It's just...

00:51:43.972 --> 00:51:45.103
It's just a simple cold.

00:51:46.833 --> 00:51:48.773
He can't even talk.

00:51:49.043 --> 00:51:51.273
Hey, do you think you can perform tonight?

00:51:52.713 --> 00:51:53.943
Darn it.

00:51:54.543 --> 00:51:56.882
Hey, kiddo. Go and get some medicine.

00:51:57.112 --> 00:51:58.252
We still have time.

00:51:58.253 --> 00:51:59.353
- Okay.
- Hurry.

00:52:08.393 --> 00:52:10.292
If you had snuck into the house,

00:52:10.293 --> 00:52:12.063
you should have just stolen some money from me quietly.

00:52:12.293 --> 00:52:15.103
Why did you have to steal my car? Look at the mess you created!

00:52:15.632 --> 00:52:18.932
I'm near the karaoke bar in Hongdae you used to work at.

00:52:23.373 --> 00:52:24.773
Okay. I got it.

00:52:25.242 --> 00:52:27.342
Hide in there until the dust settles.

00:52:28.043 --> 00:52:29.213
I'll call you back.

00:52:32.382 --> 00:52:34.381
You should take some medicine first.

The pharmacist said...

00:52:35.653 --> 00:52:37.992
you could get your voice back with some luck.

00:52:38.623 --> 00:52:39.692
- Is that so?
- Yes.

00:52:39.693 --> 00:52:40.923
Hold this.

00:52:46.492 --> 00:52:48.233
Goodness.

00:52:54.943 --> 00:52:57.201
Gosh. That's enough, you jerk.

00:52:57.202 --> 00:52:58.313

- Hey.

00:52:59.412 --> 00:53:01.382
Give me a few more. Come on.

00:53:01.742 --> 00:53:02.782
Hey.

00:53:03.342 --> 00:53:05.182
- I need the pills.
- The pills?

00:53:05.213 --> 00:53:06.682
What? Gosh.

00:53:07.182 --> 00:53:08.381
- Hey.
- Darn it.

00:53:08.382 --> 00:53:10.623
- Come on. Just go back inside.
- Give them to me.

00:53:10.722 --> 00:53:12.923
- Go back inside.
- Come on.

00:53:30.373 --> 00:53:31.412
Hello.

00:53:32.273 --> 00:53:33.273
What?

00:53:33.673 --> 00:53:36.143
What? You found what?

It has a clear shot of the driver.

00:53:50.222 --> 00:53:51.233
Ma'am.

00:53:52.092 --> 00:53:53.662

(Hardworking Seogyo Police, Safe City for Happy Citizens)

00:54:13.653 --> 00:54:15.623
Are you happy now that you ruined my son's life?

00:54:16.353 --> 00:54:17.523
Does that hit the spot?

00:54:26.992 --> 00:54:28.402
What happened is unfortunate.

00:54:28.403 --> 00:54:31.372
But this is the best for your son, Byung Ho.

00:54:31.373 --> 00:54:33.132
How dare you lecture me?

00:54:37.673 --> 00:54:39.412
Don't worry about my son.

00:54:39.742 --> 00:54:41.443
Worry about your son.

00:54:42.842 --> 00:54:45.313
You think you have the perfect son, don't you?

00:54:45.653 --> 00:54:46.712
You must be so proud,

00:54:46.713 --> 00:54:49.123
thinking you did a great job raising him.

00:54:49.452 --> 00:54:50.893
But do you know...

00:54:51.393 --> 00:54:53.992
what your so-called perfect son is doing right now?

00:54:54.693 --> 00:54:56.923
He acts as if he's a good student in front of other people,

00:54:57.592 --> 00:54:59.063
but he secretly goes clubbing.

00:54:59.132 --> 00:55:01.332
He drinks, smokes, and does drugs.

00:55:01.333 --> 00:55:02.463
Did you know that?

00:55:03.032 --> 00:55:04.062
Do you think...

00:55:04.063 --> 00:55:05.833
Eun Gyeol would have done that if he respected you as his father?

00:55:06.972 --> 00:55:08.342
Don't be fooled.

00:55:08.842 --> 00:55:11.772
It's your son who disrespects you the most in this world.

00:55:11.773 --> 00:55:12.813
Got that?

00:55:18.282 --> 00:55:19.952
What did she say just now?

00:55:21.452 --> 00:55:22.753
What did she say?

00:55:53.512 --> 00:55:55.622
- Isn't that Oh Ma Joo?
- Is that Oh Ma Joo?

00:55:55.623 --> 00:55:56.753
- This way, sir.
- Is it really him?

00:55:56.822 --> 00:55:57.922
- No way.
- Oh Ma Joo?

00:55:57.923 --> 00:55:59.792
- Really?
- What's he doing here?

00:55:59.793 --> 00:56:01.463
- No way.
- Why is he here?

00:56:03.423 --> 00:56:04.793
You should sing.

00:56:06.293 --> 00:56:07.333
Me?

00:56:07.833 --> 00:56:09.062
We don't have any other choice.

00:56:09.063 --> 00:56:11.072
They're tone-deaf. I can't let them sing.

00:56:13.003 --> 00:56:15.802
No way. How could I...

00:56:15.972 --> 00:56:17.341
You've been backing me up.

00:56:17.342 --> 00:56:18.813
You can do it. No.

00:56:19.842 --> 00:56:20.912
You must do it.

00:56:28.483 --> 00:56:29.822

- You guys are cool!

00:56:49.572 --> 00:56:53.213

00:57:00.382 --> 00:57:01.752
All right

00:57:01.753 --> 00:57:04.551
I'll tell you no matter what

00:57:04.552 --> 00:57:08.792
My heart is starting to beat

Step two, I will get up twice

00:57:17.903 --> 00:57:19.602
Yes, don't stop

00:57:19.603 --> 00:57:21.971
I can find the way

00:57:21.972 --> 00:57:27.372
Keep on knocking, and when the door opens,

00:57:27.373 --> 00:57:30.381
Then the story about the two of us

00:57:30.382 --> 00:57:33.111
Will unfold on this vast sea

00:57:33.112 --> 00:57:35.322
Knocking

00:58:03.882 --> 00:58:05.483
You lied to me.

00:58:08.523 --> 00:58:10.182
I can explain everything.

00:58:10.923 --> 00:58:12.721
You deceived me.

00:58:12.722 --> 00:58:15.293
You looked down on me and made a fool out of me.

00:58:16.023 --> 00:58:17.362
It's not that.

00:58:17.762 --> 00:58:19.132
I was going to tell you.

00:58:19.293 --> 00:58:20.762
But I never had a chance.

00:58:21.233 --> 00:58:23.233
I was going to tell you everything...

00:58:23.862 --> 00:58:25.532
after tonight's show.

00:58:25.833 --> 00:58:26.903
Tell me what?

00:58:29.273 --> 00:58:30.302
I...

00:58:33.673 --> 00:58:34.943
want to do music.

00:58:36.483 --> 00:58:37.643
I like music.

00:58:39.612 --> 00:58:40.713
I like performing on stage.

00:58:45.052 --> 00:58:46.153
You're wrong about that.

00:58:49.563 --> 00:58:51.293
You're just lost.

00:58:51.662 --> 00:58:54.062
You're distracted momentarily because school work is hard.

00:58:54.063 --> 00:58:55.631
This isn't the real you.

00:58:55.632 --> 00:58:58.632
No. This is the real me.

00:58:59.532 --> 00:59:01.342
You might not like who I am.

00:59:01.403 --> 00:59:04.103
But the guy on stage tonight was the real me.

00:59:04.472 --> 00:59:06.272
You're still in high school. But you go clubbing,

00:59:06.273 --> 00:59:08.741
drink alcohol, smoke cigarettes, do drugs, and act like a rebel.

00:59:08.742 --> 00:59:10.542
- So that's the real you?
- Who said...

00:59:10.543 --> 00:59:12.313
I drank alcohol and smoked cigarettes?

00:59:17.992 --> 00:59:19.992
Let's go home. We'll talk about this at home.

00:59:20.893 --> 00:59:22.623
You don't belong here!

00:59:24.693 --> 00:59:26.292
No. I'm not leaving.

00:59:26.293 --> 00:59:28.233
I don't want to live as your trophy anymore.

00:59:28.632 --> 00:59:30.332
I'm not your interpreter.

00:59:30.333 --> 00:59:32.631
I'm not a fire alarm or an angel.

00:59:32.632 --> 00:59:35.003
I'm just me.

00:59:41.782 --> 00:59:45.112
Then why didn't you tell me sooner about how you felt?

00:59:46.713 --> 00:59:47.782
I knew you'd behave this way.

00:59:48.322 --> 00:59:49.881
Just like now, you're set in your ways.

00:59:49.882 --> 00:59:51.222
You still should have told me!

00:59:51.952 --> 00:59:54.023
If you had respected me as a parent,

00:59:54.353 --> 00:59:55.492
you should have done...

00:59:56.623 --> 00:59:58.193
whatever you could to persuade me.

00:59:58.693 --> 01:00:00.761
That's what a family does!

01:00:00.762 --> 01:00:02.201
How could I have persuaded you?

01:00:02.202 --> 01:00:03.932
You can't even hear my music anyway!

the Almighty gave me my two sons, you and Eun Ho,

Dad!

01:00:48.782 --> 01:00:51.313

01:03:45.353 --> 01:03:46.623
Welcome.

I'm the master of this store.

01:03:50.322 --> 01:03:52.232
I'm sure it wasn't easy to find my store.

01:03:52.233 --> 01:03:53.492
What brings you here?

01:03:54.762 --> 01:03:57.161
Well, it looked just like a music store, Viva Music,

01:03:57.162 --> 01:03:58.431
I knew from a long time ago.

01:03:58.432 --> 01:04:00.372
I see. Viva Music.

01:04:00.373 --> 01:04:02.342
But this place is called La Vida Music.

01:04:03.103 --> 01:04:05.341
If you put the names together, it makes, "Viva la Vida."

01:04:05.342 --> 01:04:07.313
It interprets as... "Hooray, life!"

01:04:10.842 --> 01:04:12.382
What an interesting connection.

01:04:13.253 --> 01:04:14.282
So how can I help you?

01:04:15.483 --> 01:04:17.781
I see. Are you here to sell that guitar?

01:04:17.782 --> 01:04:19.523
- What?
- The one you're holding.

01:04:20.153 --> 01:04:22.992
Oh, this? Okay. Here you go.

01:04:23.222 --> 01:04:24.322
Let me take a look.

01:04:27.592 --> 01:04:30.632
Gosh, this is a rare guitar.

01:04:30.932 --> 01:04:32.603
Are you sure you won't regret it?

01:04:33.103 --> 01:04:34.103
Yes.

01:04:34.972 --> 01:04:36.342
How much can I get for this?

01:04:52.523 --> 01:04:53.653
I'll give you the rest later.

01:04:56.423 --> 01:04:57.922
If you need a different guitar,

01:04:57.923 --> 01:05:00.091
may I interest you in an electric guitar...

01:05:04.262 --> 01:05:05.832
Sure. I'll think about it.

01:05:05.833 --> 01:05:06.833
Okay.

01:05:10.572 --> 01:05:12.512
Come back if you have a change of heart.

01:05:12.773 --> 01:05:14.512
It won't be easy to find my store, though.

01:05:17.382 --> 01:05:20.213
No. I won't be back here again.

01:05:22.452 --> 01:05:23.923

Do not lose this transaction slip. Never. Okay?

You'll be in a tight spot if you do. Okay?

01:05:35.563 --> 01:05:37.333
Okay.

01:05:44.302 --> 01:05:45.373
I'm just goofing around.

01:05:47.643 --> 01:05:48.682
Bye.

01:05:50.182 --> 01:05:51.341

(The CNUE Monthly)

01:06:56.443 --> 01:06:57.882
(April 1995 Issue)

01:06:59.412 --> 01:07:00.412
What?

01:07:05.623 --> 01:07:06.623
Yoon Dong Jin?

01:07:09.793 --> 01:07:10.862
It's you.

01:07:11.063 --> 01:07:12.732
Oh Ma Joo!

01:07:12.733 --> 01:07:14.563
- "Oh Ma Joo?"
- He's over here!

01:07:17.003 --> 01:07:18.932
Gosh. You're here early.

01:07:22.643 --> 01:07:23.701
Who...

01:07:23.702 --> 01:07:27.442
I'm the frontman of the band, First Love Memory Manipulators.

01:07:27.443 --> 01:07:30.912
My name is Ha Yi Chan.

01:07:32.112 --> 01:07:34.713
"Ha Yi Chan?"

01:07:35.923 --> 01:07:36.982
Ha Yi Chan?

01:07:36.983 --> 01:07:38.052
Dad?

01:07:44.963 --> 01:07:46.032
It's Dad.

01:07:47.432 --> 01:07:48.463
Dad...

01:07:50.262 --> 01:07:51.262
can talk.

01:07:56.572 --> 01:07:57.802
(Kim Mi Hwa, and Kim Jun Hyung)

01:08:24.262 --> 01:08:29.142
(Twinkling Watermelon)

01:08:29.143 --> 01:08:31.102
When will we find people and practice as a band?

01:08:31.103 --> 01:08:33.112
We'll need someone like Yoon Dong Jin to make this work.

01:08:33.113 --> 01:08:34.471
I'll bring him then!

01:08:34.472 --> 01:08:36.042
Yoon Dong Jin? It's you.

01:08:36.143 --> 01:08:38.982
I'm Yoon Dong Jin.

01:08:38.983 --> 01:08:40.752
- Can I treat you like my brother?
- What?

01:08:40.853 --> 01:08:42.721
So he's joining a band to win over a girl?

01:08:42.722 --> 01:08:43.782
Who are you?

01:08:43.783 --> 01:08:45.492
If I see you, you're dead meat.

01:08:45.493 --> 01:08:48.362
Right. Mom. Why didn't I think about looking for Mom?

01:08:48.363 --> 01:08:50.121
Do you like that guy?

01:08:50.122 --> 01:08:51.892
No. Not at all.

01:08:51.893 --> 01:08:53.831
I was hoping there would be a twist. What a bummer.

01:08:53.832 --> 01:08:55.232
I'm sure there's a way.

01:08:55.233 --> 01:08:58.103
I promise to repay you for your help before I die.
