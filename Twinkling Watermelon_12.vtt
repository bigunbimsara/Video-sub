Was he talking about this?

So, that...

00:01:13.882 --> 00:01:14.952
was true?

Are you all right? Can you walk?

00:02:02.862 --> 00:02:05.061
Hey, hurry up and get on my back.

Don't worry.

00:02:09.272 --> 00:02:10.701
I lied about the cops being outside.

Hey, can you handle the consequences?

00:02:13.041 --> 00:02:15.112
Once Do Jin finds out that
you lied, you're dead meat.

00:02:15.272 --> 00:02:17.171
If that happens, I should
really call the police.

Hey, buddy.

00:02:21.082 --> 00:02:22.611
Then you should've called it in...

00:02:22.612 --> 00:02:25.082

Hello.

Oh, right.

00:03:30.411 --> 00:03:32.321

Here, hold my arm. I got you.

00:03:40.191 --> 00:03:41.232
Gosh, you're heavy.

00:03:41.561 --> 00:03:43.691
Are you all right? Don't you feel dizzy?

00:03:44.332 --> 00:03:46.160
Let's all go home and get some sleep.

00:03:46.161 --> 00:03:47.461
See you guys back at school at noon.

00:03:47.462 --> 00:03:50.172
Hey. Are you saying we should
go home now, looking like this?

00:03:50.432 --> 00:03:52.871
Hey, what a way to worry our parents.

00:03:55.672 --> 00:03:56.742
That's true.

00:03:59.911 --> 00:04:00.941
Yes.

00:04:01.482 --> 00:04:03.880
So you guys extorted money
from other kids, engaged in fistfights,

00:04:03.881 --> 00:04:06.221
broke into empty cars
together back in middle school.

00:04:06.621 --> 00:04:10.091
But you quit all that
once you started the band.

00:04:10.351 --> 00:04:12.320
And he thinks he went to juvie...

00:04:12.321 --> 00:04:13.992
because you reported him to the police?

00:04:14.161 --> 00:04:15.191
Correct.

00:04:15.792 --> 00:04:17.561
But you never reported him to the police?

00:04:17.862 --> 00:04:20.400
That's right. But Do
Jin probably knows too.

00:04:20.401 --> 00:04:21.831
That I wasn't the one who called it in.

00:04:21.832 --> 00:04:23.832
Then why haven't you cleared
up the misunderstanding?

00:04:25.202 --> 00:04:27.772
He needs someone to take
his anger out on. That's why.

00:04:29.212 --> 00:04:31.411
To him, I'm a traitor anyway.

00:04:31.412 --> 00:04:33.441
Not breaking into empty cars
with him doesn't make you a traitor.

00:04:34.112 --> 00:04:37.250
Shoot. What if he shows up at our
performance and causes a scene?

00:04:37.251 --> 00:04:38.321
Don't worry.

00:04:38.621 --> 00:04:40.982
He may be reckless, but he's not stupid.

00:04:41.321 --> 00:04:43.792
He absolutely can't cause
trouble while he's still on probation.

00:04:43.922 --> 00:04:45.121
He, of all people, knows that.

00:04:45.461 --> 00:04:46.691
You won't go back...

00:04:47.722 --> 00:04:49.331
- to your old ways, right?
- What?

00:04:52.402 --> 00:04:53.432
No.

00:04:53.701 --> 00:04:56.830
You don't have a Jindo dog tattoo, do you?

00:04:56.831 --> 00:04:58.700
- No.
- Are you sure?

00:04:58.701 --> 00:05:00.672
Hey! I really don't have such a tattoo.

00:05:00.941 --> 00:05:02.742
Why don't you search my
body if you don't believe me?

00:05:04.612 --> 00:05:06.742
What? What is this now?

00:05:11.881 --> 00:05:14.021
- Hey!
- Come here!

00:05:16.552 --> 00:05:18.120
- Looking nice.
- What do you think?

00:05:18.121 --> 00:05:19.991
- Doesn't it look nice?
- Yes.

00:05:19.992 --> 00:05:21.061
- Let me see.
- Here.

00:05:22.691 --> 00:05:24.932
- Just press it once.
- Oh, this is cool.

00:05:47.321 --> 00:05:49.552
- Am I really your dad?
- What?

00:05:50.492 --> 00:05:53.592
You said I was your dad,
and you were my son.

00:05:55.691 --> 00:05:57.431
You said you knew my future...

00:05:57.432 --> 00:05:59.662
and that you found out
how to change my life.

00:06:00.162 --> 00:06:01.571
That's why you wanted
to cancel the rehearsal.

00:06:03.571 --> 00:06:04.571
How did you know?

00:06:05.472 --> 00:06:07.302
How did you show up, knowing I'd get hurt?

00:06:10.641 --> 00:06:11.682
The truth is...

00:06:12.612 --> 00:06:15.482
My father doesn't like that I'm in a band.

00:06:18.982 --> 00:06:20.782
So I ran away from home
in the heat of the moment.

00:06:21.751 --> 00:06:22.792
But the thing is,

00:06:23.422 --> 00:06:26.292
he found out the date of our rehearsal.

00:06:27.821 --> 00:06:30.061
If I get caught, he'll send
me to a school abroad.

00:06:31.662 --> 00:06:34.000
So I had no choice but to lie to you.

00:06:34.001 --> 00:06:35.701
I'm sorry.

00:06:36.532 --> 00:06:38.071
- Are you telling me the truth?
- Yes, it's true.

00:06:38.402 --> 00:06:39.802
- For real?
- Yes, for real.

00:06:41.511 --> 00:06:45.081
I knew it. Gosh, you almost had me fooled.

00:06:45.711 --> 00:06:46.841
My gosh.

00:06:46.842 --> 00:06:48.581
I can't believe I
almost fell for such a lie.

00:06:50.711 --> 00:06:52.721
Hold on. You're so dead.

00:06:52.722 --> 00:06:55.492
How dare you rope Se
Gyeong into something like that?

00:06:55.592 --> 00:06:56.651
You promised me...

00:06:56.652 --> 00:06:58.591
you wouldn't see her
until the day of the festival!

00:06:58.592 --> 00:07:00.021
Hey! You little...

00:07:02.761 --> 00:07:03.890
What?

00:07:03.891 --> 00:07:06.131
Hey, the movie is about to
start. Where are you going?

00:07:06.631 --> 00:07:07.862
Hey, Eun Gyeol!

00:07:11.842 --> 00:07:14.042
Hey! Where are you going, naked?

00:07:30.222 --> 00:07:33.060
Se Gyeong! I know you're inside.

00:07:33.061 --> 00:07:34.992
Come out for a moment.
I need to talk to you!

00:07:35.492 --> 00:07:38.361
Se Gyeong! One moment would do.

00:07:38.362 --> 00:07:40.631
- Choi Se Gyeong!
- Be quiet, or I'll call the police!

00:07:49.842 --> 00:07:50.911
I'm sorry.

00:07:50.912 --> 00:07:52.310
(Woori Mart)

00:07:52.311 --> 00:07:53.842
I wronged you, big time.

00:07:54.482 --> 00:07:57.281
The truth is, there's
something I can't tell you...

00:07:57.282 --> 00:08:00.581
No, I'll tell you. I'm just
going to tell you everything.

00:08:01.052 --> 00:08:03.592
To tell you the truth, I was worried
Yi Chan would get into an accident.

00:08:03.852 --> 00:08:04.961
So I... No.

00:08:05.961 --> 00:08:07.390
I scrambled to get the rehearsal cancelled,

00:08:07.391 --> 00:08:08.862
but they got together again to rehearse.

00:08:09.761 --> 00:08:10.761
I mean...

00:08:17.001 --> 00:08:18.071
Anyway, I'm sorry.

00:08:19.141 --> 00:08:20.570
Go ahead and beat me up if you want to.

00:08:20.571 --> 00:08:22.370
Cuss me out all you want.

00:08:22.371 --> 00:08:24.242
I don't care what you do if
it can make you feel better.

00:08:24.941 --> 00:08:26.811
Just don't avoid me, please.

00:08:27.342 --> 00:08:28.982
Give me a chance to
apologize to you in person...

00:08:33.782 --> 00:08:36.251
(Who is the bandsman Mom loved?)

00:08:39.621 --> 00:08:41.162
There's something you don't know.

00:08:41.792 --> 00:08:43.561
There's nothing I hate more...

00:08:45.532 --> 00:08:47.002
than being abandoned.

00:08:58.042 --> 00:09:00.642
I was so preoccupied with Dad's accident...

00:09:01.752 --> 00:09:03.611
that I let my other missions slip my mind.

00:09:07.851 --> 00:09:09.951
I must make Mom smile...

00:09:10.552 --> 00:09:12.522
and make sure Mom and
Dad can end up together.

00:09:13.561 --> 00:09:16.892
And to do that, I must make sure
Se Gyeong stays away from Dad.

00:09:17.762 --> 00:09:20.162
- And...
- Talk about a cat thief.

00:09:23.672 --> 00:09:26.042
I thought I'd successfully
kicked you out. Was I wrong?

00:09:26.302 --> 00:09:28.542
I must free Mom from that witch too.

00:09:28.941 --> 00:09:30.471
Since you're here anyway,
empty the guest room.

00:09:30.912 --> 00:09:32.481
Get your things and leave.

00:09:35.851 --> 00:09:37.451
I never said I'd move out.

00:09:43.221 --> 00:09:45.821
You didn't go to school and
didn't come home without a word.

00:09:46.461 --> 00:09:47.990
Do I need another reason to kick you out?

00:09:47.991 --> 00:09:51.061
I faxed the details to Chairman Yoon
and got his permission in advance.

00:09:52.632 --> 00:09:53.902
I told you.

00:09:54.601 --> 00:09:56.432
Chairman Yoon is my employer.

00:09:57.071 --> 00:09:58.101
Move out.

00:09:58.542 --> 00:10:00.541
Leave quietly while I'm still
treating you like a human being.

00:10:00.542 --> 00:10:02.611
I told you that Chung Ah was
the only person in this household...

00:10:03.841 --> 00:10:05.011
that I cared about.

00:10:05.012 --> 00:10:06.440
Shall I get you dragged out?

00:10:06.441 --> 00:10:08.552
Who are you to tell him to move out?

00:10:13.221 --> 00:10:14.382
Welcome home, Mr. Chairman.

00:10:14.782 --> 00:10:16.922
Did you have a good business trip?

00:10:18.122 --> 00:10:19.820
You should wait in the study.

00:10:19.821 --> 00:10:21.292
I'd like to talk to you in private.

00:10:21.591 --> 00:10:22.632
Yes, sir.

00:10:26.831 --> 00:10:27.961
Since when...

00:10:28.172 --> 00:10:30.532
did you start acting like you
were the one calling the shots?

00:10:31.071 --> 00:10:33.372
- Mr. Chairman.
- Who gave you such authority?

00:10:36.042 --> 00:10:37.841
I'm sure you've already looked into it,

00:10:38.111 --> 00:10:40.382
but he's a nobody from
goodness knows where.

00:10:40.642 --> 00:10:42.151
Because he thinks you've got his back,

00:10:42.152 --> 00:10:44.412
he's being incredibly arrogant.

00:10:45.252 --> 00:10:48.792
More importantly, your two
grown daughters live here too.

00:10:49.292 --> 00:10:51.960
You're always very cautious
when it comes to hiring new people.

00:10:51.961 --> 00:10:53.161
I can't believe you hired that boy.

00:10:53.162 --> 00:10:55.131
I clearly told you not to
try to change my mind...

00:10:55.132 --> 00:10:56.860
about him staying with us.

00:10:56.861 --> 00:10:58.861
- Mr. Chairman.
- End of discussion!

00:11:02.132 --> 00:11:03.172
Mr. Chairman.

00:11:08.101 --> 00:11:09.142
They say...

00:11:10.142 --> 00:11:14.241
blood is thicker than water. I hope
that's not why you're fond of him.

00:11:19.721 --> 00:11:21.652
With that remark,

00:11:22.652 --> 00:11:25.091
you flat out insulted Ju Yeop and Sang A...

00:11:25.522 --> 00:11:27.422
while making me look
like a despicable scumbag.

00:11:28.792 --> 00:11:29.792
Are you satisfied?

00:11:37.601 --> 00:11:40.372
- Pardon me?
- I'm terminating our agreement.

00:11:40.672 --> 00:11:44.512
But there are still five
days left in the agreement.

00:11:45.042 --> 00:11:48.081
It's too slow. When
investing, timing is everything.

00:11:51.012 --> 00:11:53.081
Sir, you probably don't know this,

00:11:53.252 --> 00:11:55.721
but Chung Ah has changed a lot.

00:11:56.091 --> 00:11:57.421
Her sign language has improved a lot,

00:11:57.422 --> 00:11:58.791
and she has many friends now.

00:11:58.792 --> 00:12:00.320
She has learned to open up to others,

00:12:00.321 --> 00:12:01.461
and most importantly,

00:12:02.561 --> 00:12:03.861
she smiles often now.

00:12:04.061 --> 00:12:06.361
I suppose you've forgotten
the terms of our agreement.

00:12:06.561 --> 00:12:09.470
You promised to show me her smile.

00:12:09.471 --> 00:12:12.371
You're away so often
because of your work trips.

00:12:12.372 --> 00:12:15.042
Shall I forget about the company
and stay home every day, then?

00:12:17.412 --> 00:12:19.012
In any case, this is not fair.

00:12:19.282 --> 00:12:20.480
The head of a conglomerate...

00:12:20.481 --> 00:12:22.110
wrongfully dismissing a
young employee like this...

00:12:22.111 --> 00:12:24.080
So I'd like to extend it by one month.

00:12:24.081 --> 00:12:25.752
Then I'll have to report
you to the Labour Board...

00:12:26.522 --> 00:12:29.121
Pardon me? You'd like to extend it?

00:12:29.122 --> 00:12:31.922
We'll cancel the original agreement
and extend it by one month.

00:12:32.122 --> 00:12:35.632
However, I'll be tweaking
the terms and conditions.

00:12:35.932 --> 00:12:36.961
The terms and conditions?

00:12:37.892 --> 00:12:38.961
How?

00:12:40.162 --> 00:12:41.772
She has to smile at me.

00:12:43.272 --> 00:12:44.302
Who?

00:12:45.441 --> 00:12:46.502
Chung Ah?

00:12:46.841 --> 00:12:48.542
Why? You don't think you can do it?

00:12:53.111 --> 00:12:54.142
I'll try.

00:12:55.052 --> 00:12:56.752
All right, that's it. You can go.

00:13:02.652 --> 00:13:04.521
- Sir.
- I won't help you.

00:13:04.522 --> 00:13:05.721
Figure things out on your own.

00:13:05.991 --> 00:13:07.622
I really want you to see it.

00:13:08.662 --> 00:13:09.731
See what?

00:13:09.861 --> 00:13:11.191
Chung Ah's smile.

00:13:13.201 --> 00:13:14.601
She has such a pretty smile.

00:13:36.652 --> 00:13:39.691
Which one did I like more
before I left to go study abroad?

00:13:39.922 --> 00:13:40.961
Ha Eun Gyeol.

00:13:41.991 --> 00:13:44.162
I have no doubt that Eun
Gyeol is the one she likes.

00:13:46.802 --> 00:13:48.061
(Ha Eun Gyeol)

00:13:49.331 --> 00:13:50.372
Ha Eun Gyeol.

00:13:51.231 --> 00:13:52.641
I'm certain...

00:13:52.642 --> 00:13:55.211
that Se Gyeong will choose
Eun Gyeol today, not Yi Chan.

00:14:04.282 --> 00:14:06.682
You'll come to the festival today, right?

00:14:08.052 --> 00:14:09.652
Yes, I'll be there.

00:14:16.861 --> 00:14:18.731
I won't let Mom cry, no matter what.

00:14:19.402 --> 00:14:20.902
I must do whatever it takes...

00:14:21.231 --> 00:14:23.831
to win Se Gyeong's heart
before the festival begins.

00:14:26.772 --> 00:14:27.772
Se Gyeong!

00:14:28.711 --> 00:14:30.412
Are you going to the festival
at Baekwang High later today?

00:14:31.211 --> 00:14:33.181
Well, I guess you're going.

00:14:33.182 --> 00:14:36.210
What? Why would I go there?

00:14:36.211 --> 00:14:37.581
Clearly, you're going.

00:14:37.912 --> 00:14:40.051
Well, if you say you're going,

00:14:40.052 --> 00:14:43.151
I should probably go with you.

00:14:43.152 --> 00:14:45.522
I mean, I can't let you walk into
the wolves' den all by yourself.

00:14:45.662 --> 00:14:48.161
You don't really look like you
care whether or not I'll be there.

00:14:48.162 --> 00:14:50.162
What do you mean?
What do I look like, then?

00:14:51.762 --> 00:14:53.331
You look like an outcast trying so hard...

00:14:54.662 --> 00:14:55.731
to fit in.

00:14:57.172 --> 00:14:59.172
What does that mean? Is that
supposed to be a compliment?

00:15:00.002 --> 00:15:02.311
What does it mean? Se Gyeong.

00:15:03.042 --> 00:15:05.811
Se Gyeong. Answer me, will you?

00:15:13.752 --> 00:15:15.022
Se Gyeong, can we talk?

00:15:16.091 --> 00:15:17.951
Hi, good morning.

00:15:20.662 --> 00:15:22.861
What was that? Did she
use sign language just now?

00:15:23.331 --> 00:15:26.002
Is she out of her mind? What
if people think she's deaf?

00:15:28.571 --> 00:15:29.831
Sorry. Get going.

00:15:32.201 --> 00:15:34.002
Something's going on
between those two, right?

00:15:34.372 --> 00:15:35.441
You must know something.

00:15:36.341 --> 00:15:39.081
Those little... Hey!

00:15:39.782 --> 00:15:42.682
Se Gyeong, let's talk.

00:15:44.951 --> 00:15:46.052
I'll tell you everything.

00:15:48.321 --> 00:15:50.721
I said I'd tell you my secret
when the time was right.

00:15:51.991 --> 00:15:53.061
I'll tell you all about it now.

00:15:56.392 --> 00:15:58.132
I don't know if you'll believe me,

00:15:59.331 --> 00:16:01.831
- but I'm actually...
- My parents got a divorce.

00:16:02.201 --> 00:16:03.271
What?

00:16:03.272 --> 00:16:05.802
And they fought over me for a whole year.

00:16:07.002 --> 00:16:08.471
I thought they loved me,

00:16:09.142 --> 00:16:10.211
but I was wrong.

00:16:10.711 --> 00:16:12.412
They both had their own goals and agendas.

00:16:13.241 --> 00:16:15.911
My dad didn't want to look like a
bad person who abandoned his child,

00:16:15.912 --> 00:16:18.922
and my mom needed a fancy
accessory that could make her life shine.

00:16:19.552 --> 00:16:20.721
I'm done being the girl...

00:16:20.981 --> 00:16:24.392
who is only loved when
she is needed or useful.

00:16:24.821 --> 00:16:27.922
I don't want to be anyone's
trophy, war booty, or accessory.

00:16:28.361 --> 00:16:29.392
That's not what I'm doing.

00:16:29.792 --> 00:16:31.392
- I'm...
- This is like a hunting game.

00:16:32.331 --> 00:16:33.360
What?

00:16:33.361 --> 00:16:35.571
All men like to trophy-hunt.

00:16:36.971 --> 00:16:38.132
Don't say you're different.

00:16:39.172 --> 00:16:40.241
You're not any different.

00:16:40.802 --> 00:16:42.141
You'd stuff the animals you caught,

00:16:42.142 --> 00:16:44.171
hang them on your wall, and
boast about how you hunted them.

00:16:44.172 --> 00:16:45.381
When you get tired of it, you won't care...

00:16:45.382 --> 00:16:46.581
whether they collect dust or disappear.

00:16:46.741 --> 00:16:47.912
You'll just neglect them.

00:16:48.682 --> 00:16:51.012
- Se Gyeong.
- Give up already.

00:16:51.552 --> 00:16:53.351
I will not let you catch me.

00:16:53.552 --> 00:16:56.091
I do not want to get stuffed
and hung on someone's wall.

00:16:59.561 --> 00:17:00.622
So?

00:17:02.162 --> 00:17:03.491
Will you choose Yi Chan?

00:17:04.262 --> 00:17:05.532
Why do you care?

00:17:10.502 --> 00:17:11.872
Then don't come to the festival.

00:17:15.441 --> 00:17:17.111
If you're coming, you have to choose me.

00:17:18.142 --> 00:17:19.142
Get lost.

00:17:19.582 --> 00:17:21.241
Don't you dare tell me what to do.

00:17:36.662 --> 00:17:37.731
Hey.

00:17:38.932 --> 00:17:40.231
Were you waiting for me?

00:17:40.602 --> 00:17:42.372
Why? Do you need to talk
to me about something?

00:17:44.501 --> 00:17:45.501
You know, today...

00:17:46.172 --> 00:17:48.041
You'll choose Eun Gyeol, right?

00:17:49.642 --> 00:17:52.812
No, bet your money on Yi Chan.

00:17:53.541 --> 00:17:55.682
It's just between you and me.

00:18:01.221 --> 00:18:03.291
From now on, I'm only
going to focus on my mission.

00:18:04.521 --> 00:18:05.562
I'll only think about the mission.

What time?

00:18:29.211 --> 00:18:30.510
- At 5pm!
- At 5pm!

Yes, you should all come!

00:19:03.852 --> 00:19:05.781
Everyone, come and watch us perform.

00:19:09.352 --> 00:19:11.151
- Can I get one too?
- Here.

00:19:11.152 --> 00:19:12.960

- Me!

(Baekwang High School's 25th
Anniversary, Sparkling Festival)

00:19:22.971 --> 00:19:24.172
Surprise.

00:19:25.941 --> 00:19:27.271
You came really early.

00:19:28.941 --> 00:19:32.112
Shall I give you a tour of my school?

00:19:37.652 --> 00:19:39.152
I have to go back to school.

00:19:39.481 --> 00:19:41.451
They suddenly decided to
hold a supplementary class.

00:19:43.051 --> 00:19:44.892
"School?" "Class?"

00:19:46.191 --> 00:19:48.461
Oh, I see. You have to go back to school?

00:19:50.662 --> 00:19:53.761
What? Then...

00:19:54.701 --> 00:19:57.971
Why did you come here so early?

00:20:10.312 --> 00:20:11.312
My gosh.

Gosh, this is so cool!

00:20:20.062 --> 00:20:21.162
Is this for me?

00:20:24.531 --> 00:20:25.561
It's my gift to you.

00:20:25.562 --> 00:20:27.932
"Gift?" That's what it means, right?

00:20:29.301 --> 00:20:32.241
Did you make these for me?

00:20:34.102 --> 00:20:36.511
Thank you. Seriously, thanks a lot.

00:20:37.672 --> 00:20:39.281
I'll definitely use this
when I perform later.

00:20:39.642 --> 00:20:40.682
Like this.

00:20:42.652 --> 00:20:45.082
Oh, right. You'll come and
see us perform later, right?

00:20:47.122 --> 00:20:49.951
You'll come to my performance, right?

00:20:51.322 --> 00:20:53.961
No, I won't be there.

No.

Do you not know how to sell things?

Sorry. Cleaning took longer than I thought.

00:22:30.791 --> 00:22:31.822
Where's Yi Chan?

00:22:32.021 --> 00:22:33.761
Gosh, I'm so popular.

00:22:34.362 --> 00:22:35.990
Everyone's looking for me, wherever I go.

00:22:35.991 --> 00:22:38.631
Hey, we're so busy. Where have you been?

00:22:38.632 --> 00:22:40.500
I had to stop by the woodworking
room to make something.

00:22:40.501 --> 00:22:42.902
- What did you make?
- Try and find it.

00:22:43.432 --> 00:22:44.932
Gosh, this is so cool.
Where did you get this?

00:22:45.031 --> 00:22:46.701
Hey, I don't know.

00:22:46.801 --> 00:22:48.271
Chung Ah gave it to me and left.

00:22:48.441 --> 00:22:50.811
Mom... I mean, Chung Ah was here?

00:22:50.812 --> 00:22:53.940
Yes. She's very professional.

00:22:53.941 --> 00:22:55.951
See? She takes such
good care of the frontman.

00:22:56.211 --> 00:22:59.021
What should I do? I haven't even
reconciled with Se Gyeong yet.

00:22:59.082 --> 00:23:01.020
Why didn't you bring her
here? Why are you here alone?

00:23:01.021 --> 00:23:03.250
She had to go back to her class.
She'll come back after her class.

00:23:03.251 --> 00:23:04.291
She's got a class?

00:23:04.951 --> 00:23:06.661
Oh, no. The rumour was true.

00:23:06.662 --> 00:23:08.521
Rumour? What rumour?

00:23:08.892 --> 00:23:10.591
Seowon Arts High is
notorious for doing this.

00:23:10.592 --> 00:23:11.790
They suddenly hold supplementary classes...

00:23:11.791 --> 00:23:13.432
whenever there's a
school festival in the area.

00:23:13.501 --> 00:23:15.402
- Why?
- What do you think?

00:23:15.602 --> 00:23:17.601
Getting excited about festivals
could negatively impact...

00:23:17.602 --> 00:23:18.901
their students' grades,

00:23:18.902 --> 00:23:20.902
and they don't want their
students to date and cause trouble.

00:23:21.102 --> 00:23:23.511
What? Does that mean Se
Gyeong might not make it?

00:23:24.372 --> 00:23:27.541
Hey, a model student like Se Gyeong
won't skip her supplementary class.

00:23:27.781 --> 00:23:28.812
You idiot.

00:23:31.852 --> 00:23:32.950
No wonder...

00:23:32.951 --> 00:23:35.221
I didn't really see anyone wearing
Seowon Arts High's uniform.

00:23:37.352 --> 00:23:39.892
We're doomed. We failed.

00:23:40.162 --> 00:23:42.361
Gosh, what should we do?

00:23:42.362 --> 00:23:45.291
We need to sell everything
here to cover our costs.

00:23:45.592 --> 00:23:46.931
It's okay, guys.

00:23:46.932 --> 00:23:48.701
As our frontman said,

00:23:48.862 --> 00:23:51.030
"If you push the wall, it
becomes a bridge. If you fall..."

00:23:51.031 --> 00:23:52.300
Oh, Choi Se Gyeong is here!

00:23:52.301 --> 00:23:54.341
- What? Choi Se Gyeong?
- What?

00:23:54.342 --> 00:23:56.710
- My gosh!
- Se Gyeong!

00:23:56.711 --> 00:23:57.912
- Come on, quick!
- Se Gyeong!

00:24:00.011 --> 00:24:01.111
- Oh, my.
- There she is.

00:24:01.112 --> 00:24:03.082
- Hey, that's Choi Se Gyeong.
- She's really pretty.

00:24:03.582 --> 00:24:05.011
- My gosh.
- She's so pretty.

00:24:06.281 --> 00:24:07.451
Where you fall...

00:24:08.322 --> 00:24:11.392
You will find a hidden treasure!

00:24:21.102 --> 00:24:22.831
Se Gyeong, you came.

00:24:22.832 --> 00:24:24.771
Of course, I promised you that I would.

00:24:24.902 --> 00:24:26.971
- My gosh.
- Oh, my.

00:24:27.072 --> 00:24:28.500
Se Gyeong, can we talk?

00:24:28.501 --> 00:24:31.011
Just so you know, this has
nothing to do with the bet.

00:24:31.072 --> 00:24:33.412
You'd better do a good job
with your performance today.

00:24:36.312 --> 00:24:38.852
Of course. You know
who the performance is for.

00:24:40.322 --> 00:24:41.520
- Hey.
- Oh, right.

00:24:41.521 --> 00:24:44.550
We still have plenty of time.
Shall I give you a tour of the school?

00:24:44.551 --> 00:24:46.521
- Sure!
- Or do you want to see our booth?

00:24:46.622 --> 00:24:48.720
Well, give me a tour
of your school first...

00:24:48.721 --> 00:24:50.030
I'll give you a tour. Spare me a moment...

00:24:50.031 --> 00:24:52.460
Actually, I want to
check out your booth first.

00:24:52.461 --> 00:24:53.661
Let's go. Where is it, Ma Joo?

00:24:53.662 --> 00:24:54.902
Follow me!

00:24:55.102 --> 00:24:56.102
Let's go!

00:24:57.902 --> 00:24:59.771
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

00:24:59.941 --> 00:25:01.300
This is it here.

00:25:01.301 --> 00:25:03.071
This is your booth. It looks nice.

00:25:03.072 --> 00:25:04.271
You guys did a good job.

00:25:05.372 --> 00:25:06.381
Look, Se Gyeong.

00:25:06.382 --> 00:25:08.641
I displayed the photos you took.

00:25:08.642 --> 00:25:11.051
I see. But you guys
haven't sold a single one.

00:25:11.652 --> 00:25:12.750
Shall I be your first customer?

00:25:12.751 --> 00:25:14.082
- Really?
- Yes.

00:25:15.021 --> 00:25:16.092
Hold on.

00:25:16.221 --> 00:25:18.950
Let's see. First, I want Ma Joo's photo.

00:25:18.951 --> 00:25:19.961
Yes!

00:25:20.221 --> 00:25:21.461
Next, Se Bum.

00:25:22.021 --> 00:25:23.291
Hyun Yul.

00:25:23.592 --> 00:25:25.061
(Lee Si Guk)

00:25:25.062 --> 00:25:26.101
Si Guk.

00:25:26.102 --> 00:25:27.131
(Ha Yi Chan)

00:25:27.132 --> 00:25:29.470
And my cute Yi Chan.

00:25:29.471 --> 00:25:30.901
(Ha Eun Gyeol)

00:25:30.902 --> 00:25:33.300
All right, that would do.
Can I get the T-shirt too?

00:25:33.301 --> 00:25:34.501
You want the T-shirt? Okay.

00:25:34.572 --> 00:25:36.970
Here it is.

00:25:36.971 --> 00:25:37.971
Here.

00:25:38.941 --> 00:25:40.641
- It'll look good on me, right?
- Of course!

00:25:40.642 --> 00:25:43.211
That's a given. Why bother asking?

00:25:45.751 --> 00:25:48.521
- Oh, my.
- Applause!

00:25:49.751 --> 00:25:50.921
I want one too!

00:25:50.922 --> 00:25:52.460
Okay, what size?

00:25:52.461 --> 00:25:53.861
- Okay.
- I need one too!

00:25:53.862 --> 00:25:56.432
Yes!

00:25:58.031 --> 00:25:59.230
Se Gyeong!

00:25:59.231 --> 00:26:01.401
- Hi.
- Hi. You know...

00:26:01.402 --> 00:26:04.171
Can you please come and play
the game my club organized?

00:26:04.172 --> 00:26:06.601
It's the most famous game
at the festival. Let's play...

00:26:06.602 --> 00:26:07.871
- No.
- Why not?

00:26:07.872 --> 00:26:09.540
She's a cellist. What
if she hurts her hand?

00:26:09.541 --> 00:26:12.041
No, Yi Chan. It sounds
fun. Let's play it together.

00:26:12.412 --> 00:26:13.511
- Shall we?
- Yes.

00:26:13.612 --> 00:26:15.381
Guys, we should all do it
together. What do you say?

00:26:15.382 --> 00:26:16.450
- Shall we?
- Sure.

00:26:16.451 --> 00:26:17.611
Wait, hold on.

00:26:17.612 --> 00:26:19.882
One person should stay and
man the booth. Who will stay?

00:26:31.662 --> 00:26:35.632
- Choi Se Gyeong!
- Choi Se Gyeong!

00:26:37.872 --> 00:26:38.932
Eun Gyeol.

00:26:39.741 --> 00:26:40.872
How's it going here?

00:26:41.072 --> 00:26:42.301
Where's everyone else?

00:26:42.572 --> 00:26:43.572
What?

00:26:44.511 --> 00:26:45.812
Watch the booth for me.

00:26:46.582 --> 00:26:47.682
What? Where are you going?

00:26:48.781 --> 00:26:51.911
All eyes are on us now! This
is the match of the century.

00:26:51.912 --> 00:26:53.450
It's happening right now, today!

00:26:53.451 --> 00:26:55.151
Sworn enemies met on a single-log bridge.

00:26:55.152 --> 00:26:57.790
Round Four! Hold in your
burps after downing the soda!

00:26:57.791 --> 00:27:00.392
Applause, everyone!

00:27:03.162 --> 00:27:05.260
You get one minute.

00:27:05.261 --> 00:27:06.261
Are you ready?

00:27:06.961 --> 00:27:08.562
Are you ready? Stand by.

00:27:09.501 --> 00:27:10.531
Start!

00:27:29.852 --> 00:27:32.621
- Choi Se Gyeong!
- Choi Se Gyeong!

00:27:32.622 --> 00:27:35.321
- Choi Se Gyeong!
- Seven, six,

00:27:35.322 --> 00:27:38.131
- Choi Se Gyeong!
- five, four, three, two,

00:27:38.132 --> 00:27:39.832
- Choi Se Gyeong!
- one. You team lost!

00:27:44.701 --> 00:27:48.700
- Choi Se Gyeong!
- Choi Se Gyeong!

00:27:48.701 --> 00:27:50.311
Round Five!

00:27:50.312 --> 00:27:54.311
Who can make the biggest bubble?

00:27:54.312 --> 00:27:56.611
All right. Get ready and start!

00:27:56.612 --> 00:27:58.551
Go!

00:28:00.751 --> 00:28:02.251
- Nice, that's it.
- Keep going.

00:28:02.991 --> 00:28:05.551
- Oh, my!
- My gosh!

00:28:31.751 --> 00:28:33.381
Quiet down!

00:28:33.382 --> 00:28:34.651
(Baekwang High School's Sparkling Festival)

00:28:34.652 --> 00:28:35.721
Quiet down, please.

00:28:40.721 --> 00:28:42.162
No chitchat.

00:28:42.632 --> 00:28:44.291
- Be quiet.
- Sorry.

00:28:44.461 --> 00:28:45.562
Wait in an orderly fashion.

00:28:47.701 --> 00:28:49.161
Stay seated.

00:28:49.162 --> 00:28:50.372
Se Gyeong.

00:28:51.332 --> 00:28:53.801
I said we should go together,
but you left without me.

00:28:54.072 --> 00:28:55.641
Will you keep hurting
my feelings like this?

00:28:55.642 --> 00:28:56.911
You're the chairwoman's daughter.

00:28:56.912 --> 00:28:58.671
Was I supposed to lure you
into skipping the class with me?

00:28:58.672 --> 00:29:00.011
That's exactly my point.

00:29:00.481 --> 00:29:02.611
I skipped the supplementary class
and came here because of you,

00:29:02.612 --> 00:29:04.011
but you aren't even happy to see me.

00:29:04.511 --> 00:29:07.551
I asked you about my style
earlier, but you ignored me.

00:29:09.021 --> 00:29:10.451
You're stylish, so you
don't care how I look?

00:29:10.822 --> 00:29:12.352
I thought we were closer than this!

00:29:15.862 --> 00:29:17.162
That headband doesn't suit you.

00:29:18.231 --> 00:29:20.861
- What?
- I think you're Cool Summer.

00:29:20.862 --> 00:29:23.271
Such vivid colours are the worst
for those with Cool Summer tones.

00:29:23.432 --> 00:29:25.871
You should go for muted tones or mauve.

00:29:25.872 --> 00:29:28.072
"Cool Summer?"

00:29:28.441 --> 00:29:31.011
"Vivi..." What?

00:29:31.241 --> 00:29:32.342
Hey.

00:29:32.471 --> 00:29:35.281
Let's keep our mouths shut and
get ready to enjoy the performance.

00:29:36.882 --> 00:29:38.581
Hey, it'll be a lame performance anyway.

00:29:38.582 --> 00:29:39.881
The band was put
together at the last minute.

00:29:39.882 --> 00:29:41.682
It'll look like a kids' talent show.

00:29:43.852 --> 00:29:45.521
(The début show of Watermelon Sugar)

00:29:59.572 --> 00:30:00.801
I can do this. Yes.

00:30:23.362 --> 00:30:24.362
Son.

00:30:27.132 --> 00:30:28.761
What is it? Are you already nervous?

00:30:34.342 --> 00:30:35.402
Yi Chan.

00:30:35.602 --> 00:30:37.441
What? Shall I pick up some
calming medicine for you?

00:30:43.751 --> 00:30:45.481
I won't go easy on you today.

00:30:47.551 --> 00:30:48.652
You think you're the only one?

00:30:50.951 --> 00:30:51.991
Hey, I have one too.

00:30:52.822 --> 00:30:54.491
Stop acting cool.

00:30:56.062 --> 00:30:58.291
They'll call a standby in three
minutes. Are you guys ready?

00:30:58.392 --> 00:31:00.432
Of course. Come on, brothers.

00:31:04.132 --> 00:31:06.741
- You can do a good job, right?
- Yes. I always do a good job.

00:31:07.271 --> 00:31:08.271
You too?

00:31:08.541 --> 00:31:10.241
With each mistake you make,
you'll get three teeth knocked out.

00:31:10.441 --> 00:31:12.342
Then you'll get dentures soon, Yi Chan.

00:31:14.241 --> 00:31:15.312
All right.

00:31:16.041 --> 00:31:17.411
Who are we?

00:31:17.412 --> 00:31:19.281
- Watermelon Sugar!
- Watermelon Sugar!

- La Vida!

Your name

00:31:42.342 --> 00:31:45.842
Your story

00:31:47.112 --> 00:31:51.312
And I'm left with

00:31:56.852 --> 00:31:57.892
Drums!

00:32:01.291 --> 00:32:02.291
Bass!

00:32:05.892 --> 00:32:06.932
Guitar!

00:32:10.731 --> 00:32:11.771
Piano!

00:32:15.842 --> 00:32:19.781
It still wasn't enough

00:32:20.741 --> 00:32:24.852
The way you were looking at me

00:32:25.112 --> 00:32:29.321
Like the love scattered around the world

00:32:29.322 --> 00:32:32.551
Everything was uncertain back then

00:32:34.291 --> 00:32:38.432
As time goes by

00:32:39.162 --> 00:32:43.332
We're bound to forget things

00:32:43.572 --> 00:32:47.871
But it is now that I am leaving

00:32:47.872 --> 00:32:50.912
Your shadows behind

00:32:53.011 --> 00:32:58.311
I never told you that I loved you

00:32:58.312 --> 00:33:02.250
Although I regret it now

00:33:02.251 --> 00:33:06.260
Your late confession

00:33:06.261 --> 00:33:10.791
I'm leaving that confession behind

00:33:12.031 --> 00:33:14.001
Everybody, get up!

00:33:15.902 --> 00:33:20.440
Your face, your name

00:33:20.441 --> 00:33:25.071
Your story and my lovely bygone days

00:33:25.072 --> 00:33:29.651
It may seem like this love came true

00:33:29.652 --> 00:33:34.051
But I'm left with nothing but a farewell

00:33:53.301 --> 00:33:55.270
Amazing! My gosh.

00:33:55.271 --> 00:33:57.072
He's so good.

00:33:57.842 --> 00:33:59.342
Hold on. Ha Eun Gyeol, that guy...

00:34:00.112 --> 00:34:01.141
Wasn't it him?

00:34:01.142 --> 00:34:03.082
The one who had a jam
session with Ji Hwan's band.

00:34:03.912 --> 00:34:06.112
Who did what?

00:34:06.281 --> 00:34:07.981
Those two.

00:34:08.352 --> 00:34:09.691
With Ji Hwan's band.

00:34:10.152 --> 00:34:11.152
Dad...

00:34:11.852 --> 00:34:14.961
No, I mean... Ji Hwan is in a band?

00:34:15.261 --> 00:34:16.261
Hey, what's with you?

00:34:16.262 --> 00:34:19.161
You came with me when I went
to Myeongse Outdoor Theatre.

00:34:19.162 --> 00:34:21.701
To see Ji Hwan's band
perform. Don't you remember?

00:34:23.301 --> 00:34:24.901
Yes, it's him.

00:34:25.272 --> 00:34:27.142
No wonder I thought he looked so familiar.

00:34:28.741 --> 00:34:30.272
Se Gyeong. You knew, didn't you?

00:34:31.611 --> 00:34:33.441
Where are you going? Are
you going to the restroom?

00:34:33.442 --> 00:34:34.982
It's bright outside

00:34:37.682 --> 00:34:39.151
Walking briskly

00:34:40.082 --> 00:34:42.622
In the morning

00:34:44.491 --> 00:34:46.321
Everyone is

00:34:46.921 --> 00:34:49.062
Humming together

00:34:52.031 --> 00:34:55.760
Waiting for a sunny day

00:34:55.761 --> 00:34:59.231
With a heart full of excitement

00:34:59.232 --> 00:35:02.771
Crossing paths

00:35:02.772 --> 00:35:06.241
Affectionate gazes fill the streets

00:35:07.341 --> 00:35:08.341
- Hey!
- Hey!

00:35:10.912 --> 00:35:11.912
- Hey!
- Hey!

00:35:15.022 --> 00:35:17.192
Did I tell you my first love was in a band?

00:35:17.951 --> 00:35:20.662
So the bandsman was Dad?

00:35:21.761 --> 00:35:23.491
You see, my first love...

00:35:26.261 --> 00:35:28.401
He was cheerful and bright like sunshine.

00:35:36.301 --> 00:35:38.142
He seemed indifferent
and cold from time to time,

00:35:38.942 --> 00:35:40.642
but he was kind.

00:35:57.361 --> 00:35:59.562
(You're my music.)

00:36:05.401 --> 00:36:07.201
And he only loved me, always.

00:36:12.571 --> 00:36:13.781
Look, what a handsome dog.

00:36:15.082 --> 00:36:16.111
This won't be spicy, right?

00:36:16.381 --> 00:36:17.582
It looks spicy.

00:36:18.312 --> 00:36:19.412
I'll try it.

00:36:20.252 --> 00:36:21.281
Isn't it spicy?

00:36:21.682 --> 00:36:23.820
Oh, that's right. He was
very good at eating spicy food.

00:36:23.821 --> 00:36:25.392
- It's not spicy at all.
- It's not spicy?

00:36:25.921 --> 00:36:26.962
Try it.

00:36:31.361 --> 00:36:32.832
I couldn't handle spicy food.

00:36:34.332 --> 00:36:35.361
Oh, gosh.

00:36:38.772 --> 00:36:40.340
- Oh, my gosh.
- My gosh.

00:36:40.341 --> 00:36:42.670
- You're handsome.
- Oh, my gosh.

00:36:42.671 --> 00:36:44.570
How can he be so good-looking?

00:36:44.571 --> 00:36:47.341
- He's handsome.
- He's handsome.

00:36:49.241 --> 00:36:50.281
What?

00:36:51.451 --> 00:36:53.581
- My goodness.
- How is he so sweet?

00:36:53.582 --> 00:36:56.051
He's so cool.

00:36:56.151 --> 00:36:57.591
I didn't know when I was younger.

00:36:58.522 --> 00:37:01.591
Because we were like siblings.

00:37:02.591 --> 00:37:03.662
But...

00:37:04.261 --> 00:37:09.732
You're a beautiful woman

00:37:10.131 --> 00:37:14.241
And I'm happy

00:37:16.071 --> 00:37:18.442
You're like much-needed rain

00:37:19.142 --> 00:37:23.951
You're like much-needed
rain to my dry heart

00:37:25.151 --> 00:37:29.581
You're like the scent
of dawn that is forgotten

00:37:29.582 --> 00:37:31.651
I was sure that he was the one...

00:37:31.951 --> 00:37:33.221
at the spring festival.

00:37:34.861 --> 00:37:38.090
That day, he serenaded me...

00:37:38.091 --> 00:37:40.131
at the festival.

00:37:50.912 --> 00:37:53.042
He was my dad?

00:37:55.442 --> 00:37:58.682
Your first love was my
dad when he was younger?

00:38:04.292 --> 00:38:05.352
Se Gyeong.

00:38:09.361 --> 00:38:10.562
Do you know me?

00:38:17.401 --> 00:38:18.571
Do you know me?

00:38:21.901 --> 00:38:24.142
I'm sorry. I was mistaken.

00:38:28.241 --> 00:38:30.551
It's okay.

00:38:33.982 --> 00:38:35.682
That was awesome.

00:38:38.852 --> 00:38:39.920
(Baekwang High School's Sparkling Festival)

00:38:39.921 --> 00:38:42.860
Are you guys having fun?

00:38:42.861 --> 00:38:44.161
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:38:44.162 --> 00:38:45.991
I can't hear you.

00:38:46.361 --> 00:38:48.962
Say it louder!

00:38:49.162 --> 00:38:52.470
Are you guys having fun?

00:38:52.471 --> 00:38:54.641
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:38:54.642 --> 00:38:55.701
Thank you.

00:38:57.442 --> 00:38:59.671
I'm going to dedicate the last song...

00:39:02.942 --> 00:39:04.651
to a girl.

00:39:09.682 --> 00:39:11.451
I'm going...

00:39:12.051 --> 00:39:14.591
to sing this song...

00:39:15.091 --> 00:39:18.292
for the girl who made our band possible.

00:39:20.261 --> 00:39:23.232
It's "The Magic Castle" by The Classic.

00:39:24.171 --> 00:39:25.332
Darn it.

00:39:29.942 --> 00:39:31.812
(Baekwang High School's Sparkling Festival)

00:40:01.142 --> 00:40:05.671
When I gaze at the
setting sun, tinged with red

00:40:06.071 --> 00:40:09.312
The sad look on your face comes to my mind

00:40:09.812 --> 00:40:13.281
I sink my head, and tears fall down

00:40:13.482 --> 00:40:16.021
There's nothing I can say

00:40:16.022 --> 00:40:18.951
But the truth is that I love you

00:40:19.622 --> 00:40:22.392
You are my world

00:40:23.162 --> 00:40:25.990
I'm screaming that to the world

00:40:25.991 --> 00:40:30.071
But the setting sun burns silently

00:40:30.801 --> 00:40:33.971
(Watermelon Sugar)

00:40:34.042 --> 00:40:36.442
- Can I have your autograph?
- Gosh.

00:40:37.671 --> 00:40:39.711
- What's your name?
- Hye In.

00:40:39.712 --> 00:40:41.141
- Sorry?
- Hye In.

00:40:41.142 --> 00:40:42.241
Hye In.

00:40:45.781 --> 00:40:46.781
Then...

00:40:51.321 --> 00:40:53.022
Where are you going?
There's an after-party.

00:40:53.662 --> 00:40:56.420
Sign the autograph for me before you go.

00:40:56.421 --> 00:40:57.891
Just for me.

00:40:57.892 --> 00:40:59.260
- It's my bad.
- No.

00:40:59.261 --> 00:41:01.061
- Viva.
- La Vida.

00:41:01.062 --> 00:41:03.502
- Watermelon.
- Sugar.

00:41:05.372 --> 00:41:08.041
Look. The table looks so beautiful...

00:41:08.042 --> 00:41:10.041
when you order the right
amount of food for you.

00:41:10.042 --> 00:41:12.171
So is there anything else you need?

00:41:13.011 --> 00:41:14.381
One more free plate of
fried dumplings, please.

00:41:14.741 --> 00:41:17.611
I could raise a cow, but I can't raise you.

00:41:18.352 --> 00:41:20.022
One more seafood and vegetables
with mustard sauce, please.

00:41:21.221 --> 00:41:23.450
- Oh, my.
- Oh, my.

00:41:23.451 --> 00:41:25.321
I'm going to raise a cow today.

00:41:25.392 --> 00:41:27.462
I can tell that you're blessed with luck.

00:41:27.991 --> 00:41:29.761
You're definitely going to become rich.

00:41:30.932 --> 00:41:32.232
Give us stir-fried seafood and beef too.

00:41:32.531 --> 00:41:35.961
- Oh Ma Joo.
- Oh Ma Joo.

00:41:35.962 --> 00:41:38.431
Seafood and vegetables with
mustard and stir-fried seafood and beef.

00:41:38.432 --> 00:41:40.301
- Let's get it started.
- Let's do it.

00:41:40.901 --> 00:41:42.872
Can you really eat the noodles right now?

00:41:45.111 --> 00:41:48.511
Didn't you think that something
was off while performing today?

00:41:55.252 --> 00:41:56.621
It's okay.

00:41:56.622 --> 00:41:59.451
We lost the bet, but it was
a successful performance.

00:41:59.951 --> 00:42:02.392
Yes. Se Gyeong is very considerate.

00:42:02.861 --> 00:42:04.931
She didn't reject you...

00:42:04.932 --> 00:42:06.392
in front of the whole school.

00:42:06.761 --> 00:42:08.931
"Reject?" Who?

00:42:08.932 --> 00:42:10.101
You.

00:42:10.102 --> 00:42:11.701
She didn't reject me.

00:42:12.272 --> 00:42:14.400
Kind Se Gyeong finished
it with an open ending...

00:42:14.401 --> 00:42:15.942
with the wisdom of Solomon.

00:42:16.872 --> 00:42:19.841
Because she didn't want to
choose one of us and hurt the other.

00:42:20.642 --> 00:42:22.482
Because she didn't want us to disband.

00:42:23.212 --> 00:42:24.881
That's who she is.

00:42:25.451 --> 00:42:28.280
She's righteous and loyal.

00:42:28.281 --> 00:42:31.150
I thought it was a cartoon
theme song or something.

00:42:31.151 --> 00:42:32.221
Are you done now?

00:42:33.321 --> 00:42:35.622
Let's slurp the noodles now.

00:42:35.721 --> 00:42:36.792
Sounds great.

00:42:40.432 --> 00:42:42.462
What do you mean I'm done, you punks?

00:42:42.701 --> 00:42:44.531
Chung Ah isn't here.

00:42:45.131 --> 00:42:46.941
- Oh, right.
- Chung Ah?

00:42:46.942 --> 00:42:48.201
"Oh, right?"

00:42:49.042 --> 00:42:50.142
Gosh.

00:42:50.841 --> 00:42:52.812
These disloyal punks.

00:42:53.142 --> 00:42:55.510
You just want to eat even
when your colleague...

00:42:55.511 --> 00:42:57.951
who has always been with us isn't here.

00:42:59.451 --> 00:43:01.281
You're no better than animals.

00:43:11.432 --> 00:43:12.832
Can we meet for a moment?

00:43:13.062 --> 00:43:14.901
You decide the time and the location.

00:43:15.662 --> 00:43:16.832
Why are you not answering?

00:43:17.971 --> 00:43:19.432
Are you not home yet?

00:43:20.772 --> 00:43:22.201
Is the fax broken?

00:43:23.201 --> 00:43:24.341
(Are you unwell?)

00:43:26.571 --> 00:43:27.781
Are you unwell?

00:43:29.511 --> 00:43:31.051
Did something happen?

00:43:32.412 --> 00:43:34.522
I'll be in front of your
house in 30 minutes.

00:43:34.921 --> 00:43:36.151
Can we meet for a moment?

00:43:36.551 --> 00:43:37.892
I'll wait until you come out.

00:44:13.022 --> 00:44:14.091
Hi.

00:44:18.192 --> 00:44:19.261
Where are you going?

00:44:21.131 --> 00:44:25.332
Why did you not come to
watch our performance today?

00:44:26.671 --> 00:44:27.901
I was waiting.

00:44:33.682 --> 00:44:34.881
I'm deaf.

00:44:35.741 --> 00:44:36.781
I know.

00:44:37.412 --> 00:44:38.582
I can't hear anything.

00:44:39.551 --> 00:44:40.982
I know.

00:44:42.951 --> 00:44:44.892
Why did you invite me then?

00:44:45.692 --> 00:44:48.122
Invite? Why did I invite you?

00:44:49.122 --> 00:44:50.861
- Of course, that's...
- To mock me?

00:44:51.131 --> 00:44:52.661
To make me a spectacle?

00:44:52.662 --> 00:44:53.962
- Because you pitied me?
- What?

00:44:54.261 --> 00:44:56.562
To show that you have a friend
with disabilities and look nice?

00:44:57.301 --> 00:44:59.130
"You're bad. But we're
having fun like this."

00:44:59.131 --> 00:45:00.401
Did you want to brag like this?

00:45:00.872 --> 00:45:02.071
Wait. It's too fast.

00:45:03.912 --> 00:45:04.942
Hold on.

00:45:11.582 --> 00:45:12.611
Oh.

00:45:17.022 --> 00:45:20.321
Music isn't something
you listen to just by ear.

00:45:22.591 --> 00:45:25.091
Music is something you
can feel with your eyes,

00:45:25.932 --> 00:45:27.002
mind,

00:45:27.732 --> 00:45:29.932
and heart.

00:45:33.031 --> 00:45:34.400
Don't try to act cool.

00:45:34.401 --> 00:45:35.471
It disgusts me.

00:45:38.712 --> 00:45:39.812
You're done, right?

00:45:43.582 --> 00:45:45.082
Then why did you help our band...

00:45:46.511 --> 00:45:47.551
No.

00:45:50.651 --> 00:45:52.051
Why did you help me all this time?

00:45:57.162 --> 00:45:59.692
Why did you want to be friends?

00:46:05.571 --> 00:46:06.602
Why...

00:46:09.201 --> 00:46:10.272
did you say...

00:46:11.671 --> 00:46:12.942
you liked me?

00:46:52.252 --> 00:46:53.781
I guess I'm not invisible anymore.

00:47:01.022 --> 00:47:03.192
What am I doing in front of your house?

00:47:05.332 --> 00:47:06.490
I've been worrying...

00:47:06.491 --> 00:47:08.562
why you rushed out of the
auditorium in the middle of the show.

00:47:10.232 --> 00:47:13.002
And I've been trying to figure
out a way to get you to forgive me.

00:47:17.241 --> 00:47:19.212
I think I just found a solution
for my second problem.

00:47:21.682 --> 00:47:23.011
My biggest worry was...

00:47:24.312 --> 00:47:25.712
figuring out how I was
going to apologize...

00:47:26.881 --> 00:47:28.821
to get your forgiveness.

00:47:30.951 --> 00:47:33.792
I've been thinking,
and this is the best way.

00:47:38.062 --> 00:47:39.062
I'm sorry.

00:47:41.102 --> 00:47:42.162
It's my fault.

00:47:44.102 --> 00:47:45.171
Please forgive me.

00:47:48.872 --> 00:47:50.671
Should I tell you what I did wrong?

00:47:51.111 --> 00:47:52.142
I'm sorry.

00:47:55.042 --> 00:47:56.412
I was mistaken.

00:48:01.051 --> 00:48:03.181
You looked down on me, loathed
me, and expressed hatred against me.

00:48:03.182 --> 00:48:04.852
You pulled the trifecta while
treating me as if I was invisible.

00:48:05.892 --> 00:48:06.892
Did you change your tactics?

00:48:06.893 --> 00:48:08.122
Are you apologizing as if we've never met?

00:48:09.421 --> 00:48:11.361
Anyway, I'm sorry.

00:48:11.761 --> 00:48:13.562
You'll never see me again.

00:48:13.932 --> 00:48:14.932
Bye.

00:48:17.531 --> 00:48:19.300
Hey, I'm apologizing from
the bottom of my heart.

00:48:19.301 --> 00:48:20.442
Please!

00:48:22.471 --> 00:48:24.442
Can't you just leave me alone?

00:48:25.812 --> 00:48:28.412
I have so much on my mind
that my brain is going to explode.

00:48:29.341 --> 00:48:31.450
I can't even begin to think how
I wasted my time and energy.

00:48:31.451 --> 00:48:32.751
There's no way of knowing...

00:48:32.752 --> 00:48:34.220
what I found out is the truth...

00:48:34.221 --> 00:48:36.522
or a misunderstanding.
This is driving me crazy.

00:48:37.622 --> 00:48:39.522
So I'm asking you not
to complicate this further.

00:48:41.962 --> 00:48:43.122
Did something happen?

00:48:44.131 --> 00:48:45.162
No.

00:48:46.062 --> 00:48:48.031
Even if it did, it's none of your business.

00:48:48.602 --> 00:48:49.630
Hey, Choi Se Gyeong.

00:48:49.631 --> 00:48:52.031
I won't pick anyone. Are you happy now?

00:48:53.002 --> 00:48:55.741
I'll choose neither you nor Yi Chan.

00:48:55.971 --> 00:48:57.340
That's why you're here.

00:48:57.341 --> 00:48:58.811
You're worried that I might choose Yi Chan.

00:48:58.812 --> 00:49:00.781
Why are you turning me into a bad guy?

00:49:01.312 --> 00:49:03.240
I came because I was worried about you.

00:49:03.241 --> 00:49:04.611
Don't worry about me!

00:49:05.611 --> 00:49:07.880
You and I will never have
to see each other again.

00:49:07.881 --> 00:49:09.451
You and I are...

00:49:11.221 --> 00:49:13.321
from two different worlds, to begin with.

00:49:24.901 --> 00:49:26.131
I'm going to check.

00:49:28.341 --> 00:49:30.142
I'm going to meet them in person and check.

00:50:24.162 --> 00:50:25.232
Hello.

00:50:34.142 --> 00:50:36.571
(Used Musical Instruments)

00:50:40.111 --> 00:50:42.642
(White Night)

00:51:00.091 --> 00:51:01.131
Here.

00:51:45.971 --> 00:51:47.071
What are you doing here alone?

00:51:48.182 --> 00:51:49.241
I just...

00:51:50.281 --> 00:51:51.451
liked the song.

00:51:54.051 --> 00:51:55.781
This is a perfect song
to seduce women with.

00:52:10.872 --> 00:52:11.872
So you've tried that.

00:52:12.401 --> 00:52:13.971
Gosh, no way.

00:52:14.602 --> 00:52:17.071
This song is about a
father who lost his son.

00:52:17.171 --> 00:52:19.341
I wouldn't sing this song
just to seduce women.

00:52:27.651 --> 00:52:28.982
Don't jump to conclusions.

00:52:29.982 --> 00:52:31.521
I don't know if I'll have good fortune,

00:52:31.522 --> 00:52:33.022
but from the looks of it, I
don't have any children.

00:52:36.962 --> 00:52:38.861
(White Night)

00:52:41.102 --> 00:52:42.131
Ask me.

00:52:43.361 --> 00:52:44.432
Ask you what?

00:52:44.571 --> 00:52:46.001
Ask your face what.

00:52:46.002 --> 00:52:47.602
It's full of question marks.

00:52:48.002 --> 00:52:49.241
I'm all ears. Ask me.

00:52:51.611 --> 00:52:53.872
Of course, it's probably
about your friend, not you.

00:52:55.241 --> 00:52:57.381
I had a mission to complete.

00:52:58.752 --> 00:53:01.051
I had to fulfill the mission
even if I had to risk my life.

00:53:01.221 --> 00:53:03.621
Did I say that I could never guarantee...

00:53:03.622 --> 00:53:05.022
a wise solution?

00:53:05.352 --> 00:53:07.050
I had to get chosen by a girl...

00:53:07.051 --> 00:53:09.192
who was so out of my
league. That was the mission.

00:53:09.761 --> 00:53:12.461
It looked as if she was
going to choose the other guy.

00:53:12.462 --> 00:53:13.732
So it was really tough.

00:53:15.361 --> 00:53:17.772
- So did you fail the mission?
- No, I completed the mission.

00:53:18.631 --> 00:53:19.671
No.

00:53:20.401 --> 00:53:22.301
It just happened that way.

00:53:22.801 --> 00:53:25.142
What do you mean? Did
she choose you over him?

00:53:25.312 --> 00:53:28.240
No. She said she wasn't
going to choose anyone.

00:53:28.241 --> 00:53:31.182
Gosh. That's strange.

00:53:31.511 --> 00:53:32.582
It is, right?

00:53:33.611 --> 00:53:36.280
Anyway, you completed the mission,

00:53:36.281 --> 00:53:37.551
but you're not happy.

00:53:39.392 --> 00:53:40.821
I'm not sure about that.

00:53:42.392 --> 00:53:44.291
It feels as if I swallowed something wrong.

00:53:44.292 --> 00:53:45.432
It's frustrating.

00:53:45.991 --> 00:53:48.761
When I forced myself
to swallow it, it stung.

00:53:49.932 --> 00:53:50.971
It aches.

00:53:51.571 --> 00:53:53.002
- That's love.
- What?

00:53:54.171 --> 00:53:57.241
Wait. Don't tell me she's your first love.

00:53:57.442 --> 00:53:59.141
Gosh, don't tease me.

00:53:59.142 --> 00:54:01.212
She and I can never end up together.

00:54:02.241 --> 00:54:04.181
There's no limit to love.

00:54:04.182 --> 00:54:05.252
There is.

00:54:05.651 --> 00:54:07.752
I can't overcome a 28-year age gap.

00:54:07.852 --> 00:54:11.522
Gosh. Oh, my.

00:54:12.022 --> 00:54:14.421
A 28-year age gap?

00:54:15.421 --> 00:54:16.562
That might be hard.

00:54:20.591 --> 00:54:23.562
It's okay. Stuff like that
can happen in your youth.

00:54:25.401 --> 00:54:27.471
Immaturity can't be an
excuse for my actions.

00:54:28.071 --> 00:54:30.741
You'll end up writing
great lyrics for a song.

00:54:37.341 --> 00:54:38.611
What a beautiful moon.

00:54:41.252 --> 00:54:43.221
This is the perfect night
to get one's heart broken.

00:54:48.162 --> 00:54:49.361
The festival is over.

00:54:50.392 --> 00:54:51.892
Don't come to see me ever again.

00:54:52.792 --> 00:54:56.332
You and I live in different worlds, anyway.

00:55:39.841 --> 00:55:41.142
- What's wrong with her?
- I don't know.

00:55:55.292 --> 00:55:57.191
Gosh. Seriously.

00:55:57.192 --> 00:55:59.591
Se Gyeong has been acting
like a different person lately.

00:55:59.861 --> 00:56:03.161
It's not like going to the US is as
easy as taking the bus downtown.

00:56:03.162 --> 00:56:04.701
She treated it as if she
was going to a corner shop.

00:56:04.872 --> 00:56:06.670
She said, "I'm going to the US. Bye."

00:56:06.671 --> 00:56:07.942
How can anyone just do that?

00:56:10.502 --> 00:56:12.372
No, I'm being serious right now.

00:56:12.471 --> 00:56:15.211
She said she was going to the US right now.

00:56:15.212 --> 00:56:17.681
I just talked to her on
the phone. Who is this?

00:56:17.682 --> 00:56:18.781
What are you talking about?

00:56:19.651 --> 00:56:20.780
Where's Se Gyeong going?

00:56:20.781 --> 00:56:23.151
You must have a death
wish, seriously. Darn it.

00:56:24.491 --> 00:56:25.622
The United States!

00:56:27.022 --> 00:56:28.392
Don't worry about me!

00:56:29.321 --> 00:56:31.590
You and I will never have
to see each other again.

00:56:31.591 --> 00:56:32.991
You and I are...

00:56:34.901 --> 00:56:36.962
from two different worlds, to begin with.

00:56:51.852 --> 00:56:53.281
Taxi!

00:56:56.651 --> 00:56:58.522
Taxi!

00:57:02.522 --> 00:57:03.792
Do you like me?

00:57:05.062 --> 00:57:06.361
Be honest with me.

00:57:07.091 --> 00:57:11.531
Is it me? Or is it Yi Chan?

00:57:16.701 --> 00:57:17.741
Taxi!

00:57:25.651 --> 00:57:26.812
I bet you've never dated.

00:57:27.551 --> 00:57:29.721
You've never dated, right? I knew it!

00:57:31.221 --> 00:57:36.062
Look at you, you've never dated

00:57:50.602 --> 00:57:53.042
Taxi!

00:57:54.212 --> 00:57:55.281
Taxi!

00:58:06.921 --> 00:58:09.562
(Entrance)

00:58:17.401 --> 00:58:18.801
You can't go in there!

00:58:34.182 --> 00:58:35.321
(Gimpo International Airport)

00:58:40.091 --> 00:58:42.462
(International Departures)

00:58:42.792 --> 00:58:45.062
(International Departures)

00:59:20.631 --> 00:59:23.732
Why are you crying here all
alone? You're breaking my heart.

00:59:25.732 --> 00:59:27.801
I don't know how to go back.

00:59:30.602 --> 00:59:33.171
I need to check some
things with my parents.

00:59:34.611 --> 00:59:36.142
I have questions for them too.

00:59:37.412 --> 00:59:40.412
I thought I would be able to go
back as easily as I came here.

00:59:42.451 --> 00:59:44.151
But I can't find my way back.

00:59:46.022 --> 00:59:48.421
I even thought about not going back.

00:59:50.662 --> 00:59:52.392
But now, I can't go back even if I wanted.

00:59:53.232 --> 00:59:54.261
What should I do?

00:59:55.131 --> 00:59:57.432
What if I can't go back
for the rest of my life?

00:59:58.932 --> 01:00:00.171
I'll help you.

01:00:01.671 --> 01:00:02.741
How?

01:00:03.401 --> 01:00:04.471
How can you help me?

01:00:04.841 --> 01:00:06.141
I'll make it work.

01:00:06.142 --> 01:00:09.312
I'll do whatever it takes to
help you find your way back.

01:00:11.182 --> 01:00:12.881
But stay here with me for now.

01:00:19.051 --> 01:00:20.321
Stay with me.

01:00:41.142 --> 01:00:43.812
You said we were from
two different worlds, right?

01:00:45.482 --> 01:00:46.551
But I don't care.

01:00:52.752 --> 01:00:55.022
I don't care if you're a middle-aged woman.

01:00:56.921 --> 01:00:58.591
I don't care if you turn
out to be a zombie.

01:01:01.732 --> 01:01:04.062
That's why we should...

01:01:05.301 --> 01:01:06.502
stay together.

01:02:04.122 --> 01:02:07.562
It looks like you finally
found your helper.

01:02:11.801 --> 01:02:14.401
I hope it wasn't too late, though.

01:02:29.951 --> 01:02:32.852
(Special thanks to Park Ho San and Ryu Jin)

01:03:00.111 --> 01:03:04.920
(Twinkling Watermelon)

01:03:04.921 --> 01:03:07.590
How are we going to
write a song in a month?

01:03:07.591 --> 01:03:09.391
How about a one-day song retreat?

01:03:09.392 --> 01:03:10.990
We can decide on the theme of our song.

01:03:10.991 --> 01:03:12.161
We can bond as a band too.

01:03:12.162 --> 01:03:15.061
Your trip is nearing its end now.

01:03:15.062 --> 01:03:17.801
When we met by chance, I
liked that you were honest.

01:03:17.932 --> 01:03:21.170
That's really me! I'm serious!

01:03:21.171 --> 01:03:22.240
What about Yoon Chung Ah?

01:03:22.241 --> 01:03:23.300
You didn't care that she
didn't come to the festival.

01:03:23.301 --> 01:03:25.110
You don't seem concerned that
she's not coming to the retreat.

01:03:25.111 --> 01:03:27.011
What's your problem?

01:03:27.212 --> 01:03:29.611
When your life can
twinkle again on its own,

01:03:30.011 --> 01:03:32.111
I hope it twinkles as
radiantly as possible...

01:03:32.682 --> 01:03:34.752
because I don't have
much time left with me.
