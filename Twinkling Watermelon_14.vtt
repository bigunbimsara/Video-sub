00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.460
Darn it. Please work.

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.300
- Hey. - What are you doing?

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:30.588
Come on. Why? It reminds me of "Squid Game." It looks nice.

00:01:30.589 --> 00:01:32.989
I sold my cello because I'd rather die than play it.

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:34.959
- Where did you sell it to? - At a musical instrument store.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.399
- Missus! - Mister!

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.409
I have a secret that I can't share with you.

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:50.139
I saw that in the future.

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:51.449
Where was the store?

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:52.849
Was it in front of Hongdae?

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:54.849
Shut your mouth when I'm being nice, Mister.

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:55.919
Missus.

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:58.050
The time traveller Master was talking about...

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.520
The helper Master was talking about...

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:02.490
- It was you? - It was you?

00:02:05.559 --> 00:02:06.589
Son.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.529
We have to get off at the next station. What are you guys doing?

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:15.339
What's that thing in your hand?

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.440
- What? - It's...

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:20.809
Why are you so flustered?

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:23.510
Hand it over.

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.249
Come on. Take it out again.

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:28.879
Hey, where are you going?

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.248
Hey! Wait!

00:02:31.249 --> 00:02:34.188
Hey! Ha Eun Gyeol! Sir, wait.

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:35.658
Excuse me. One moment!

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:37.520
What are you guys doing?

00:02:37.619 --> 00:02:41.300
Hey! Sir, my friends just jumped off the train. Hey!

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:46.499
Hurry up and get back here. What are you guys doing?

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.499
Hey, hop back on at once!

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.170
- What? - What are they doing?

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:03.020
This can't be.

00:03:03.179 --> 00:03:04.619
How could Ms. Choi... I mean,

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.290
how could you be the other time traveller?

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.819
Everyone in 1995 thinks that you're Choi Se Gyeong.

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.490
It's because I look just like her.

00:03:13.189 --> 00:03:15.360
My face. I look just like my mom.

00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:18.070
- Your mom? - Yes.

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:21.700
I'm On Eun Yu, Choi Se Gyeong's daughter from 2023.

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.740
Hold on. What about you? Who are you, really?

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:26.339
Me?

00:03:27.369 --> 00:03:30.779
I'm Ha Yi Chan and Yoon Chung Ah's son from 2023,

00:03:31.649 --> 00:03:32.679
Ha Eun Gyeol.

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:34.249
What?

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:36.149
Are you two shooting a movie or what?

00:03:36.619 --> 00:03:38.149
Get back here at once.

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:40.149
We'll wait here until you come back.

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:42.919
Hey, the next train won't arrive until an hour later.

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.790
Just tell them to meet us at the cottage.

00:03:45.029 --> 00:03:46.989
Forget what I said earlier. Just come to the cottage...

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:49.398
Hey, what if they get lost though?

00:03:49.399 --> 00:03:50.529
They don't know how to get there.

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:52.369
Darn it, seriously.

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:56.898
Wait right there until I figure out a solution.

00:03:56.899 --> 00:03:59.170
Don't go anywhere. If you do, I will kill you!

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:06.149
So you mean...

00:04:08.249 --> 00:04:09.980
you are Yi Chan's son?

00:04:10.749 --> 00:04:11.820
So...

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:15.089
you are Choi Se Gyeong's daughter?

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.789
It's fascinating how your genes can change.

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:19.259
You look nothing like Yi Chan.

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.499
The power of genes is truly amazing.

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:23.429
You look like her clone.

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:26.670
Hold on. So, you've been...

00:04:26.999 --> 00:04:28.838
hitting on my mom?

00:04:28.839 --> 00:04:31.038
On a woman who's the same age as your parents?

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:34.738
Look who's talking. You made a move on Ha Yi Chan, my dad.

00:04:34.739 --> 00:04:36.278
At least, I had a legitimate reason.

00:04:36.279 --> 00:04:37.439
What? A reason?

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:38.979
Fine, let's hear it. What was your reason?

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:40.479
Does this mean "name?"

00:04:41.049 --> 00:04:43.449
- This means "name?" - If this means "name..."

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:45.390
- Are you all right? - No.

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.989
Gosh, I never thought Eun Gyeol would do something like this.

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.659
How could he pull this when you just got over the rejection?

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:54.159
Anyway,

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:56.299
- cheer up. - I can't.

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:58.099
I won't.

00:05:00.599 --> 00:05:02.668
How could I cheer up after seeing that?

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:05.269
- Brother! - Brother!

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:06.738
- Please. - Choose me.

00:05:06.739 --> 00:05:07.978
I can't believe this.

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:09.679
For me, seeing her smile once...

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.278
is harder than winning the lottery... My gosh.

00:05:11.279 --> 00:05:13.809
- Brother. - Brother.

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:17.119
- Look at me, pick me - My goodness.

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.389
- Gosh, is that funny? - Brother!

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:21.559
"Brother!" Is this funny to you?

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.588
What about it is funny? What part?

00:05:23.589 --> 00:05:25.528
What about this is... Hey, look.

00:05:25.529 --> 00:05:26.889
- Brother. - Why are you doing this?

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:30.529
My gosh. Hey, look at that. Guys!

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.270
You were trying to make sure Yi Chan and Chung Ah would end up together?

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:35.738
But why?

00:05:35.739 --> 00:05:38.609
Won't they end up together even if you don't step in?

00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:40.940
Did you really have to play Cupid for them?

00:05:41.609 --> 00:05:42.680
It was because of you.

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:46.380
- What? - Because you suddenly came back.

00:05:47.109 --> 00:05:49.149
- Se Gyeong. - Hi.

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:50.979
It's been a while, Yi Chan.

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:53.120
In the past, you were cold as ice to him.

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:55.918
But you suddenly started being so friendly with him.

00:05:55.919 --> 00:05:57.389
I went to the ice cream shop and was told...

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:58.829
that you had a practice session today.

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:00.560
So I'm here to show you my support.

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:03.359
Ta-Da! How about we go to the amusement park?

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:05.929
If Mom and Dad don't end up together...

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:08.399
because of you, then I...

00:06:10.899 --> 00:06:11.969
I won't be born.

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:18.680
What about you?

00:06:19.149 --> 00:06:21.479
Why did you suddenly start being so friendly with Yi Chan?

00:06:21.719 --> 00:06:23.380
Pretending to be your mom, at that.

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:26.390
- It was because of you. - What?

00:06:26.649 --> 00:06:28.659
You called my mom's name.

00:06:29.159 --> 00:06:30.890
- Choi Se Gyeong? - No, I'm not.

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:34.288
It is you. Don't you know who I am?

00:06:34.289 --> 00:06:37.930
And you told me about Yi Chan.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.898
Don't you feel bad for Yi Chan at all?

00:06:39.899 --> 00:06:41.269
You're the reason he started the band,

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:43.769
and he's practicing so hard day and night because of you.

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:45.769
How could you leave without a word?

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:48.809
Because of what you said, I thought Yi Chan was my mom's first love,

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:51.140
and I had to make sure they'd end up together no matter what.

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:55.919
But why? Why did you want them to end up together?

00:06:56.279 --> 00:06:57.380
Because I didn't want to be born.

00:06:58.489 --> 00:07:01.859
I thought, if Mom ended up marrying her first love instead of Dad,

00:07:02.859 --> 00:07:04.260
I wouldn't have to be born.

00:07:05.159 --> 00:07:10.130
So it was couple-making versus couple-breaking.

00:07:10.359 --> 00:07:12.899
In other words, we were like a spear and shield.

00:07:13.799 --> 00:07:14.870
Hold on.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.669
Hey, didn't you say you were a CODA?

00:07:17.969 --> 00:07:19.038
Yes.

00:07:19.039 --> 00:07:20.238
(Dreamy Café)

00:07:20.239 --> 00:07:23.239
Yes, we just got the keys to the cottage from your friend.

00:07:24.109 --> 00:07:25.810
Yes, we didn't get lost at all.

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:27.250
We put our heads together.

00:07:28.719 --> 00:07:31.390
Oh, sir. I'm sorry,

00:07:31.489 --> 00:07:34.390
but could you pick up two runaways on your way here?

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:39.289
A dumb couple got off the train one stop sooner.

00:07:40.359 --> 00:07:41.830
Yes, it's that station.

00:07:42.729 --> 00:07:43.799
Really?

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:46.398
Okay. Yes, will do.

00:07:46.399 --> 00:07:48.570
Thank you. I really appreciate it, sir.

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:51.569
But Yi Chan can speak.

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:53.440
And he can even sing.

00:07:53.739 --> 00:07:56.080
Are you sure Yi Chan is your dad?

00:07:56.279 --> 00:07:58.149
I only found out once I got here...

00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:02.250
that my dad became deaf later on in life.

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:05.750
He got into an accident and lost his hearing in 11th grade.

00:08:06.489 --> 00:08:07.950
In 11th grade?

00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:12.159
- That means... - Yes, in 1995.

00:08:12.729 --> 00:08:15.500
The present where we ended up in this time slip experience.

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.099
Then when will the accident take place?

00:08:18.299 --> 00:08:20.599
I already prevented it from happening.

00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:22.169
Hey!

00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:30.180
Don't hurt Yi Chan, you jerks!

00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:33.710
Gosh, thank goodness. I'm so relieved.

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:35.349
I think...

00:08:36.279 --> 00:08:38.989
I came here to prevent my dad's accident.

00:08:40.349 --> 00:08:41.390
Then what about me?

00:08:42.159 --> 00:08:44.489
Why on earth did I end up here?

00:08:46.229 --> 00:08:48.560
- That's... - And why us, of all people?

00:08:48.759 --> 00:08:49.829
Who sent us...

00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:51.900
to the same place at the same point in time? And why?

00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:55.639
There must be something that links the two of us.

00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:02.839
- Hello? Master? - Hello? Master?

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:05.109
What?

00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:07.050
Check.

00:09:10.749 --> 00:09:12.489
(Gangjeon Station)

00:09:13.989 --> 00:09:15.089
Oh, sir!

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:20.930
Are you the cottage owner picking us up?

00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:25.200
Well, it's my friend's cottage.

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:27.999
I just visit the cottage once or twice a year.

00:09:28.969 --> 00:09:30.670
Oh, I remember you now.

00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:33.940
Aren't you the gentleman who gave me his handkerchief at the festival?

00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:37.209
Thank you so much for that.

00:09:37.210 --> 00:09:38.979
Oh, no problem.

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:41.309
Anyway, how do you know each other?

00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:42.819
Oh, this is Choi Se Gyeong.

00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:44.820
She's my friend, and we go to the same school.

00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:47.119
She's also the band's exclusive photographer.

00:09:48.089 --> 00:09:49.089
I see.

00:09:49.359 --> 00:09:52.259
By the way, do you know me?

00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:55.330
I believe I heard you calling my name that day.

00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:59.468
Well, I think I heard someone calling your name in the past...

00:09:59.469 --> 00:10:01.169
Anyway, let's go. Your friends are all waiting.

00:10:01.170 --> 00:10:03.239
- Hop in. - Okay.

00:10:19.219 --> 00:10:20.690
Why do you keep sneaking a look at my face?

00:10:21.119 --> 00:10:22.219
What?

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:26.389
And you keep avoiding eye contact with me.

00:10:26.989 --> 00:10:29.229
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:32.829
I must say, she really doesn't look like she's 28 years your senior.

00:10:32.830 --> 00:10:33.830
Sir.

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:36.839
Hey, what's he saying?

00:10:37.099 --> 00:10:39.069
Did you tell him that we're from the future?

00:10:39.070 --> 00:10:40.269
I was talking about her emotional maturity.

00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:44.238
In that sense, I feel like she's 28 years older than me.

00:10:44.239 --> 00:10:46.279
- I see. - That's what I meant.

00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:48.150
What are you saying?

00:10:48.619 --> 00:10:49.749
Oh, it's nothing.

00:10:54.089 --> 00:10:55.118
It's right there.

00:10:55.119 --> 00:10:57.419
I'll be at the café.

00:10:57.420 --> 00:10:59.529
Call me if you need anything.

00:10:59.530 --> 00:11:01.389
Okay. Thank you for the ride.

00:11:19.410 --> 00:11:21.378
Age is nothing but a number,

00:11:21.379 --> 00:11:22.680
and love knows no borders...

00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:27.248
Forget it. Fine, I admit that I have a dirty mind.

00:11:27.249 --> 00:11:30.859
Hey, we'll talk about the rest once the song camp is over.

00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:34.998
Hey, let's act like we belong to this world.

00:11:34.999 --> 00:11:36.228
If people find out who we really are,

00:11:36.229 --> 00:11:38.199
the relationships will get tangled, history will change,

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:39.269
and chaos will be inevitable.

00:11:40.070 --> 00:11:42.498
Hey, that's rich coming from a boy who tried to hit on a woman...

00:11:42.499 --> 00:11:44.138
twenty-eight years his senior.

00:11:44.139 --> 00:11:45.738
Hey. Stop it, will you?

00:11:45.739 --> 00:11:48.378
Okay! Just focus on doing a good job yourself.

00:11:48.379 --> 00:11:49.809
Don't you know I'm like the master of disguise?

00:11:49.810 --> 00:11:52.080
I'm Choi Se Gyeong right now, dummy.

00:11:53.210 --> 00:11:54.280
No, you are On Eun Yu.

00:11:54.650 --> 00:11:55.879
Choi Se Gyeong is not like that.

00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:12.400
What's wrong? What's the matter?

00:12:13.830 --> 00:12:15.099
Yi Chan is angry.

00:12:17.239 --> 00:12:20.139
Do you guys view the world through a Disney filter?

00:12:21.609 --> 00:12:23.409
How dare you slack off to avoid the pain of creation?

00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:24.838
I came up with an idea.

00:12:24.839 --> 00:12:27.848
An idea, my foot. That is the biggest joke ever.

00:12:27.849 --> 00:12:29.450
This is considered plagiarism.

00:12:29.979 --> 00:12:31.080
This is just lame.

00:12:31.519 --> 00:12:34.190
This is a terrible combination of plagiarism and lameness!

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:36.189
What are you, crooks?

00:12:36.190 --> 00:12:37.988
Hey, we're here.

00:12:37.989 --> 00:12:39.530
Okay. You're here, so what?

00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:41.159
It's not like you won a war...

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:42.858
or returned home with a gold medal.

00:12:42.859 --> 00:12:44.999
What did you do that you were expecting a grand welcome?

00:12:46.229 --> 00:12:48.299
- Come with me. - All of a sudden? Now?

00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:49.799
- Yes, now. - Just me?

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:50.869
Yes, just you.

00:12:51.269 --> 00:12:53.739
Se Gyeong, what happened?

00:12:54.009 --> 00:12:55.679
Why did you suddenly jump off the train?

00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:58.608
Oh, what happened was... It certainly wasn't his fault.

00:12:58.609 --> 00:13:01.609
I had a sudden craving for noodles.

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:02.718
- Noodles? - I see.

00:13:02.719 --> 00:13:03.820
- Noodles? - Yes.

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:08.050
Chung Ah, it's not because of me.

00:13:08.519 --> 00:13:10.719
They're not fighting because of me.

00:13:14.629 --> 00:13:15.929
Anyway, take a seat.

00:13:15.930 --> 00:13:17.200
- Take a seat. - Let's sit down.

00:13:17.629 --> 00:13:18.629
- Here's a cushion. - Yes.

00:13:22.739 --> 00:13:23.769
No, this is...

00:13:24.499 --> 00:13:25.939
- Let me see. - This is a facial mask.

00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:28.810
- This is a cucumber mask. - Really? Can I try this?

00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:30.780
I'm sorry, Eun Gyeol's mother.

00:13:30.979 --> 00:13:33.580
I was so close to stealing your husband from you.

00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:35.450
I promise it won't happen again.

00:13:36.950 --> 00:13:37.950
Hand it over at once.

00:13:38.989 --> 00:13:40.050
What?

00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:41.619
It really was nothing.

00:13:45.930 --> 00:13:48.329
It was nothing? I don't buy that!

00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:49.330
Hey, stop!

00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:51.599
Ouch, don't touch me.

00:13:53.129 --> 00:13:54.200
Hey, give it back!

00:13:54.369 --> 00:13:55.799
- Give it back! - What does this thing do?

00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:57.969
- How do I use this? - Hey, seriously!

00:13:59.310 --> 00:14:01.368
It's just a voice recorder. The newest model.

00:14:01.369 --> 00:14:02.440
From a foreign brand.

00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:04.838
I carry this with me to record the melodies...

00:14:04.839 --> 00:14:06.879
whenever I come up with ideas for new songs.

00:14:07.109 --> 00:14:10.618
Take a deep breath for your new beginning

00:14:10.619 --> 00:14:11.619
Wait.

00:14:12.650 --> 00:14:13.650
That song.

00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:15.820
Did you write it?

00:14:16.489 --> 00:14:17.560
Yes.

00:14:18.359 --> 00:14:19.359
Why?

00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:21.960
Do you like it?

00:14:22.859 --> 00:14:24.200
For some reason, it sounds...

00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:28.099
lame.

00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:32.539
- Oh, my! - Nice one!

00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:34.138
- I love it. - Are you a genius?

00:14:34.139 --> 00:14:36.679
- My gosh. - Se Gyeong never disappoints.

00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:38.309
- My, it's amazing. - What is this?

00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:39.809
Hey, guys. What's going on?

00:14:39.810 --> 00:14:41.748
- What happened? - Hey, hurry up and join us.

00:14:41.749 --> 00:14:44.179
Se Gyeong came up with some ideas for the title of a song she wrote,

00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:45.388
and they're all so amazing.

00:14:45.389 --> 00:14:47.348
Hey, I cast my vote for "FIRE."

00:14:47.349 --> 00:14:49.059
Fire! It's so hot.

00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:50.459
You want something hot? Then "Dynamite," it is.

00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:51.618
- Boom! - Boom!

00:14:51.619 --> 00:14:53.189
I really like "Not Today" too.

00:14:53.190 --> 00:14:54.589
- My gosh. - Hey, seriously.

00:14:55.129 --> 00:14:56.660
- Are you out of your mind? - Shut it!

00:14:57.599 --> 00:14:59.570
- How could you be so harsh to... - Stop!

00:15:00.499 --> 00:15:01.570
Hold on.

00:15:03.239 --> 00:15:05.670
I just thought of an amazing melody line.

00:15:07.410 --> 00:15:09.409
- Do you want to hear it? - Yes.

00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:10.479
Hush.

00:15:17.349 --> 00:15:18.889
- My blood - No!

00:15:19.849 --> 00:15:20.849
Gosh.

00:15:20.850 --> 00:15:22.518
Copyright infringement can have serious consequences.

00:15:22.519 --> 00:15:23.690
- Hey. - Come with me.

00:15:24.089 --> 00:15:25.160
Why?

00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:27.859
Let go of me, and we'll talk. Your hands taste too salty!

00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:29.700
Hey, are they really dating?

00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:31.359
Don't they look more like siblings?

00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:32.530
Whatever, I don't know.

00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:35.468
This didn't work out, so let's all brainstorm alone...

00:15:35.469 --> 00:15:36.839
and meet again in an hour.

00:15:37.239 --> 00:15:38.399
- Okay. - Dismissed.

00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:39.440
- Dismissed. - Okay.

00:15:40.410 --> 00:15:42.940
Hey, seriously. Why are you so angry?

00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:44.838
"Master of disguise," my foot.

00:15:44.839 --> 00:15:47.779
Why not hold a press conference and announce you're from the future?

00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:50.378
Don't you worry. I was just goofing around.

00:15:50.379 --> 00:15:52.549
But aren't they all so innocent?

00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:53.789
They're so nice and innocent.

00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:55.889
- I'm having so much fun! - Hey!

00:15:57.190 --> 00:15:59.830
I think I know why I came here.

00:16:00.089 --> 00:16:02.759
Master said this to me while handing me the money for my cello.

00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:05.269
Why don't you go on a trip before you die?

00:16:05.530 --> 00:16:07.669
I mean, it will be a special trip.

00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:10.499
That was it. This is a trip, where I can have fun and play!

00:16:10.570 --> 00:16:13.669
Look, let me remind you that I'm a time traveller too.

00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:16.008
I'm going to play and enjoy this to the fullest.

00:16:16.009 --> 00:16:18.749
I'll work hard to complete my missions until I see two moons.

00:16:18.950 --> 00:16:20.180
Don't try to stop me.

00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:25.819
- Catch me if you can. - Why should I?

00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:27.549
What? You should catch me...

00:16:27.550 --> 00:16:28.888
because if you don't,

00:16:28.889 --> 00:16:31.018
I'll go inside and sing a song by BLACKPINK.

00:16:31.019 --> 00:16:32.858
Hey, stop! Get back here.

00:16:32.859 --> 00:16:34.060
Okay, all right.

00:16:37.129 --> 00:16:38.999
Seriously, get back here!

00:16:53.979 --> 00:16:55.249
We can take a break for an hour.

00:16:55.719 --> 00:16:57.080
How about a bike ride with us?

00:17:05.729 --> 00:17:06.960
(We can take a break for an hour.)

00:17:30.079 --> 00:17:31.079
Here.

00:17:44.059 --> 00:17:46.600
I was worried you'd be bored alone.

00:17:49.370 --> 00:17:53.640
I made sure to pick out a kitty that looked like me.

00:18:21.299 --> 00:18:22.340
A name...

00:18:23.299 --> 00:18:25.469
- based on your face? - Yes.

00:18:26.670 --> 00:18:29.139
It's confusing to use sign language to call conventional names,

00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:32.880
so you describe the person's face or personality instead.

00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:35.309
Here's an example.

00:18:35.479 --> 00:18:38.748
"A cat with a mark under its chin." Like this.

00:18:38.749 --> 00:18:39.789
I see.

00:18:41.090 --> 00:18:42.090
Then...

00:18:43.289 --> 00:18:46.759
do you have such a name too?

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:48.999
Yes.

00:18:50.059 --> 00:18:51.130
What is it?

00:19:03.009 --> 00:19:04.180
What does this mean?

00:19:16.989 --> 00:19:18.190
"A clear sound."

00:19:19.130 --> 00:19:21.289
My mom, who left me when I was little, gave me the name.

00:19:29.299 --> 00:19:30.340
It's a pretty name.

00:19:30.999 --> 00:19:32.210
From now on,

00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:36.880
I'll call you by this name.

00:19:40.509 --> 00:19:42.450
I came up with a name for you.

00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:45.279
For me? My name?

00:19:46.249 --> 00:19:47.249
What is it?

00:19:54.329 --> 00:19:55.390
What does it mean?

00:20:02.739 --> 00:20:04.200
"A shining voice."

00:20:08.039 --> 00:20:11.380
I can't hear your voice, but I see it. I can feel it.

00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:14.380
You shine the brightest when you're doing music.

00:20:14.610 --> 00:20:15.779
It's when you look the coolest.

00:20:16.579 --> 00:20:19.048
So don't worry about me...

00:20:19.049 --> 00:20:20.989
and focus on your music as the frontman of the band.

00:20:21.650 --> 00:20:24.390
I'm not bored, and I don't feel like I'm left out.

00:20:24.819 --> 00:20:27.590
I have my eyes and my heart.

00:20:28.090 --> 00:20:29.229
And I have things to do.

00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:38.940
Time's up. Shall we head back?

00:21:28.150 --> 00:21:29.259
- "Shining?" - "Shining?"

00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:30.460
Yes.

00:21:33.930 --> 00:21:36.199
What? Earlier, you said it was lame.

00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:38.630
Hey, that's just something I said when I was immature.

00:21:38.829 --> 00:21:40.228
Everyone grows.

00:21:40.229 --> 00:21:41.729
Oh, I like it.

00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:45.170
I like it as our theme, and it's a good title too.

00:21:45.299 --> 00:21:46.340
You heard that, right?

00:21:46.610 --> 00:21:48.210
Our manager here...

00:21:48.410 --> 00:21:50.709
can precisely predict the music chart rankings,

00:21:50.710 --> 00:21:53.808
so he's seriously considering opening a psychic studio in Miari.

00:21:53.809 --> 00:21:54.910
Keep that in mind,

00:21:55.549 --> 00:21:56.749
and let's compose this song.

00:21:56.950 --> 00:21:58.680
Are we making rice cakes here or what?

00:21:58.890 --> 00:22:01.289
Hey, even if we have rice, it won't automatically turn into rice cakes.

00:22:01.519 --> 00:22:02.890
Hey, what was that melody again?

00:22:11.529 --> 00:22:12.529
Did it go like this?

00:22:13.569 --> 00:22:14.799
Hey, you remember it?

00:22:15.069 --> 00:22:16.468
It's not me.

00:22:16.469 --> 00:22:19.468
It's my genius DNA flowing in my body.

00:22:19.469 --> 00:22:21.038
Goodness. He's at it again.

00:22:21.039 --> 00:22:22.410
Can someone put him on a leash?

00:22:22.779 --> 00:22:23.840
After that...

00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:34.989
With a chord like this.

00:22:36.019 --> 00:22:37.019
What do you think?

00:22:38.759 --> 00:22:39.759
I like it.

00:22:40.259 --> 00:22:41.328
It's pretty good.

00:22:41.329 --> 00:22:43.499
Hey, what was it again? Play the chord again.

00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:48.100
Oh, I like this composition too.

00:22:50.269 --> 00:22:51.400
I'm done.

00:22:53.170 --> 00:22:54.809
Shall we check each other's work?

00:22:57.079 --> 00:22:58.079
I can't wait to see your drawing.

00:23:02.579 --> 00:23:03.620
My gosh.

00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:07.319
Isn't Yi Chan wearing all the bling-blings?

00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:12.090
This is nice. Let's go with this.

00:23:15.130 --> 00:23:17.959
My, Eun Gyeol's mother is very talented.

00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:20.229
I heard the Y2K vibes were considered trendy these days.

00:23:20.999 --> 00:23:22.799
This style would totally work in 2023 too.

00:23:24.269 --> 00:23:25.269
This is so cute.

00:23:26.170 --> 00:23:27.170
Yes?

00:23:27.410 --> 00:23:29.309
I've always been curious about this.

00:23:29.479 --> 00:23:31.009
When did you learn sign language?

00:23:31.809 --> 00:23:34.709
I learned it from my deaf friend whom I met...

00:23:34.710 --> 00:23:37.350
in the hospital when there was something wrong with my ears.

00:23:38.019 --> 00:23:40.989
He was very handsome and funny, so I learned it quickly.

00:23:43.489 --> 00:23:45.390
Was he more handsome than Eun Gyeol?

00:23:45.829 --> 00:23:48.058
Hey! How could you compare him with Eun Gyeol?

00:23:48.059 --> 00:23:49.630
Of course, Eun Gyeol is more handsome...

00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:56.899
Anyway, do you think...

00:23:56.900 --> 00:23:59.469
they can write a song in just one night?

00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:06.808
These 2 bars at the beginning of the 6-bar intro...

00:24:06.809 --> 00:24:08.609
could use some drum beats.

00:24:08.610 --> 00:24:10.049
- Something exciting. - Like this?

00:24:12.489 --> 00:24:14.548
- Yes, that's it. - That's nice.

00:24:14.549 --> 00:24:18.160
From the third bar, I think we need some backing vocals.

00:24:18.289 --> 00:24:21.159
The bass should come in at the same time.

00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:22.259
Like this?

00:24:23.860 --> 00:24:25.329
Yes, that's nice.

00:24:25.529 --> 00:24:26.900
Okay, got it.

00:24:27.569 --> 00:24:30.239
- This is A minor, right? - Let me see.

00:24:30.340 --> 00:24:31.939
A-flat and B-flat, syncopated.

00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:34.909
So the A-flat and the B-flat should be offbeat?

00:24:34.910 --> 00:24:35.940
Let's try it.

00:24:42.049 --> 00:24:43.149
- Yes. - Like that?

00:24:43.150 --> 00:24:45.319
- Yes, like that. Isn't it nice? - Oh, that sounds nice.

00:24:46.090 --> 00:24:47.988
Hey, what's the concept we're going for?

00:24:47.989 --> 00:24:50.018
- Super cool. - Yes, super cool!

00:24:50.019 --> 00:24:51.718
Whatever we do, it has to be exciting and fun.

00:24:51.719 --> 00:24:53.459
Smiling and super cool!

00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:54.488
One, two, three.

00:24:54.489 --> 00:24:55.728
- Super cool. - Super cool.

00:24:55.729 --> 00:24:57.099
Super cool. Like this!

00:24:57.100 --> 00:24:59.400
It'll start with the guitar.

00:24:59.529 --> 00:25:01.199
After that...

00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:03.469
Right? With this chord here...

00:25:08.469 --> 00:25:10.609
I'll jump in the center too.

00:25:10.610 --> 00:25:12.309
- Let's jump together. - Okay.

00:25:12.610 --> 00:25:14.509
There are two songs, including "Shining."

00:25:15.479 --> 00:25:17.150
First, we'll do this together and...

00:25:32.769 --> 00:25:33.829
Did you not sleep at all?

00:25:36.799 --> 00:25:37.799
Yi Chan.

00:25:37.999 --> 00:25:39.809
Hey, good morning.

00:25:40.539 --> 00:25:41.870
Did you not get any sleep at all?

00:25:44.579 --> 00:25:45.640
Do you think...

00:25:46.479 --> 00:25:47.809
this will work?

00:25:50.319 --> 00:25:52.019
(Take a deep breath for your new beginning)

00:25:52.180 --> 00:25:53.350
You even wrote the lyrics?

00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:57.259
I just put together the things that were brought up yesterday.

00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:00.289
Do you think it'd work?

00:26:02.259 --> 00:26:03.799
(Every night, I've been dreaming of this moment)

00:26:05.729 --> 00:26:06.930
(Just like this, don't stop)

00:26:10.239 --> 00:26:12.069
Hey, wake up. Get up.

00:26:12.239 --> 00:26:14.139
Guys, wake up. Come on.

00:26:14.140 --> 00:26:15.308
Si Guk, come here.

00:26:15.309 --> 00:26:17.140
- This is our song. - We have a song!

00:26:17.710 --> 00:26:19.038
- This song... - Did you write this?

00:26:19.039 --> 00:26:20.978
- Who wrote this? - Hey, Eun Gyeol!

00:26:20.979 --> 00:26:23.518
- Hey! - No, it was all him!

00:26:23.519 --> 00:26:25.989
- Yi Chan wrote it! - Yi Chan?

00:26:27.789 --> 00:26:28.950
He's fast asleep.

00:27:00.989 --> 00:27:05.489
Take a deep breath for your new beginning

00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:09.860
Every night, I've been dreaming of this moment

00:27:12.229 --> 00:27:16.940
Erase all the moments of the past

00:27:17.239 --> 00:27:22.509
We're together now on this sparkling stage

00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:26.548
Don't look back, you won't regret it

00:27:26.549 --> 00:27:29.008
You don't need to hesitate

00:27:29.009 --> 00:27:31.818
This opportunity won't come back for you

00:27:31.819 --> 00:27:34.349
So just get started

00:27:34.350 --> 00:27:37.959
Our radiant days

00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:40.758
- Filled with our dreams - Shining

00:27:40.759 --> 00:27:43.258
Shining, just like this

00:27:43.259 --> 00:27:45.899
Don't stop, right now

00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:49.298
Run without looking back

00:27:49.299 --> 00:27:52.169
- So you can dream again - Higher

00:27:52.170 --> 00:27:54.639
Higher, fly higher

00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:58.079
Hoping this moment lasts forever

00:28:28.370 --> 00:28:29.710
Guys, look here!

00:28:35.950 --> 00:28:37.180
Let me take a picture of you guys.

00:28:37.579 --> 00:28:38.620
- Come on. - Hey!

00:28:39.549 --> 00:28:41.190
- Guys, look at the camera! - What? Wait.

00:28:41.650 --> 00:28:43.518
- Hey! - You guys too!

00:28:43.519 --> 00:28:44.988
- Chung Ah. - Get in the frame.

00:28:44.989 --> 00:28:46.690
Get in the frame!

00:28:48.190 --> 00:28:49.528
You're doing great. Nice.

00:28:49.529 --> 00:28:51.159
- All right, we're done. - What are you doing?

00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:53.069
- How pretty! - What's with you?

00:28:53.329 --> 00:28:54.829
Gosh, I'm sorry!

00:28:55.799 --> 00:28:57.039
You guys must be hungry.

00:28:57.299 --> 00:28:59.169
All right. I'll give one piece per person to start.

00:28:59.170 --> 00:29:00.639
- One piece per person. - Thank you.

00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:01.840
Thank you!

00:29:02.039 --> 00:29:03.840
- I'm Hyun Yul. - Yes, Hyun Yul.

00:29:03.979 --> 00:29:05.139
Oh, I'd like some too.

00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:07.079
Okay, hold on.

00:29:11.079 --> 00:29:12.319
- Enjoy. - Yes, thank you.

00:29:12.989 --> 00:29:15.018
- Here. - Thank you!

00:29:15.019 --> 00:29:17.190
- Look as chipper as you can. - Okay!

00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:18.789
One, two...

00:29:19.259 --> 00:29:20.788
You guys all look so fresh.

00:29:20.789 --> 00:29:21.829
- One. - Yes!

00:29:22.559 --> 00:29:23.700
Hey, come on!

00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:27.499
Come on, guys!

00:29:41.249 --> 00:29:43.180
You all did a great job in the last two days.

00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:44.950
I'll keep it short.

00:29:45.249 --> 00:29:47.249
Just remember this one thing.

00:29:48.090 --> 00:29:50.360
MGGO.

00:29:51.259 --> 00:29:53.460
- "MG..." - What does it mean?

00:29:53.660 --> 00:29:55.329
"The moment you give up, it's game over."

00:29:56.559 --> 00:29:59.498
Of course. You'd never use a difficult idiom.

00:29:59.499 --> 00:30:00.529
I...

00:30:00.930 --> 00:30:03.539
have never once imagined us losing to Ilyoung High.

00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:06.140
Just know that.

00:30:07.670 --> 00:30:09.139
- Viva! - La...

00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:11.008
- Hey, not now. - Gosh, it's too crowded here.

00:30:11.009 --> 00:30:12.640
Guys, come on!

00:30:12.809 --> 00:30:14.078
Viva!

00:30:14.079 --> 00:30:15.478
- All right. - Let's do this.

00:30:15.479 --> 00:30:17.278
- Watermelon! - Sugar!

00:30:17.279 --> 00:30:19.749
- Let's go! - Let's go!

00:30:20.219 --> 00:30:21.850
- My goodness. - Well done.

00:30:22.190 --> 00:30:23.590
- Dismissed. - Okay!

00:30:24.519 --> 00:30:25.890
Come on. Let's go.

00:30:26.390 --> 00:30:27.460
Let's go, Chung Ah.

00:30:27.559 --> 00:30:29.360
What? No.

00:30:30.029 --> 00:30:31.660
- You're coming with me. - Where are we going?

00:30:32.029 --> 00:30:34.700
- Are you that dense? - What?

00:30:35.999 --> 00:30:37.700
How about we have a wrap-up party?

00:30:37.870 --> 00:30:40.469
Let's go, you idiot. Just go.

00:30:40.809 --> 00:30:43.309
- Hey, what are you doing? - You're...

00:30:45.180 --> 00:30:46.180
Shall we get going?

00:30:46.181 --> 00:30:49.048
- What are you doing? - Hey, I can see it.

00:30:49.049 --> 00:30:50.650
Hey, seriously.

00:30:55.989 --> 00:30:58.190
Well, you'll be born just fine.

00:30:58.390 --> 00:30:59.390
Yes.

00:31:00.329 --> 00:31:02.630
You might be born sooner than planned.

00:31:03.130 --> 00:31:05.130
- What? - What?

00:31:08.769 --> 00:31:11.940
Their families must be well-off. Their lawyers contacted us.

00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:14.369
They suggested we settle the case quietly...

00:31:14.370 --> 00:31:16.140
instead of demanding compensation later on.

00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:20.350
We shouldn't complicate things, so I told them to write apology letters.

00:31:21.950 --> 00:31:23.578
Didn't you say there was someone else?

00:31:23.579 --> 00:31:26.548
Right, Ha Yi Chan from Baekwang High School.

00:31:26.549 --> 00:31:28.049
You probably remember him.

00:31:28.719 --> 00:31:31.489
The boy who sneaked in and caused a scene at the garden party...

00:31:31.660 --> 00:31:33.329
and barged into the school with the truck.

00:31:34.430 --> 00:31:37.700
As for this case too, that boy hit the other kids first.

00:31:39.329 --> 00:31:40.870
Mr. Chairman must not find out about this.

00:31:41.930 --> 00:31:43.039
Do you understand?

00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:53.710
Go on in.

00:31:55.579 --> 00:31:56.579
Oh, right.

00:31:59.150 --> 00:32:02.190
If anyone ever tries to harass you again,

00:32:02.590 --> 00:32:03.759
call me right away.

00:32:07.759 --> 00:32:09.090
Go on in. I'm off.

00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:16.700
Bye.

00:32:29.450 --> 00:32:32.579
If you only see payphones around,

00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:35.719
tap the receiver with your finger like this.

00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:40.890
Twice.

00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:44.200
Three times, and twice again.

00:32:45.499 --> 00:32:46.569
Can you do it?

00:32:49.739 --> 00:32:51.799
Then try it.

00:33:05.019 --> 00:33:06.079
Good.

00:33:08.150 --> 00:33:09.450
I'll really get going, then.

00:33:11.289 --> 00:33:12.360
Bye.

00:33:32.910 --> 00:33:36.180
Chung Ah, what are you doing in front of the gates now?

00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:38.818
Hello, I'm in 11th grade at Baekwang High School.

00:33:38.819 --> 00:33:39.920
I'm Ha Yi...

00:33:41.989 --> 00:33:43.960
I suppose you remember me too.

00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:47.160
I only have unpleasant memories of you.

00:33:49.029 --> 00:33:51.130
Do I have to keep seeing your face here?

00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:54.499
No, I'll come back another day to properly introduce myself.

00:33:54.630 --> 00:33:55.670
Take care.

00:34:21.029 --> 00:34:22.429
You skipped your lesson,

00:34:22.789 --> 00:34:24.059
didn't come home without telling me,

00:34:24.999 --> 00:34:27.199
got roped into a fistfight while hanging out with that punk,

00:34:27.829 --> 00:34:30.639
and used sign language in front of the house to show all the neighbours.

00:34:32.769 --> 00:34:34.039
What more will you do?

00:34:34.940 --> 00:34:37.740
What more will you do to humiliate the family?

00:34:42.909 --> 00:34:43.920
Did you just scoff?

00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:46.079
How dare you scoff at me?

00:34:47.749 --> 00:34:49.018
Don't touch me.

00:34:49.019 --> 00:34:50.889
I told you not to use sign language.

00:34:51.159 --> 00:34:53.190
I'm not alone anymore.

00:34:53.260 --> 00:34:54.759
In this house, you're Queen,

00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:56.959
and your slaves whom you pay...

00:34:56.960 --> 00:34:59.058
do whatever you tell them to do,

00:34:59.059 --> 00:35:00.699
but there's a whole different world out there.

00:35:00.970 --> 00:35:04.139
My friends who listen to me and will help me live in that world.

00:35:04.740 --> 00:35:07.170
Speak.

00:35:08.010 --> 00:35:09.440
I told you to speak!

00:35:16.849 --> 00:35:18.320
Provoke me once more,

00:35:19.249 --> 00:35:21.690
and you'll see your name in the newspaper.

00:35:28.090 --> 00:35:29.360
Bring me the keys.

00:35:29.659 --> 00:35:31.259
Pardon me? Which ones?

00:35:31.260 --> 00:35:33.228
Must you ask? Bring both keys!

00:35:33.229 --> 00:35:34.269
Yes, ma'am.

00:35:44.780 --> 00:35:47.249
Yi Chan, help me. Come and get me.

00:35:58.519 --> 00:36:00.829
Dad, help me.

00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:04.159
The teacher hits me.

00:36:04.429 --> 00:36:05.960
She ties me up...

00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:07.800
and locks me in the room.

00:36:08.769 --> 00:36:11.499
I don't want to learn lip reading.

00:36:16.610 --> 00:36:17.639
Drag her out of the room.

00:36:19.849 --> 00:36:22.709
If anyone ever tries to harass you again,

00:36:22.710 --> 00:36:23.920
call me right away.

00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:38.929
Why are you standing there? Get her!

00:36:40.130 --> 00:36:41.170
Chung Ah.

00:36:41.599 --> 00:36:42.630
Chung Ah.

00:36:43.499 --> 00:36:44.539
Come on, hurry.

00:36:47.139 --> 00:36:49.570
Chung Ah...

00:36:52.579 --> 00:36:54.510
I told you to bring Chung Ah to me. What are you doing?

00:36:58.550 --> 00:36:59.650
Mr. Yoon.

00:37:04.789 --> 00:37:07.159
Dad.

00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:11.900
You made it, Chung Ah.

00:37:15.769 --> 00:37:18.539
You can finally say the word "dad."

00:37:19.909 --> 00:37:21.010
You did great, Chung Ah.

00:37:21.670 --> 00:37:22.970
You did amazing.

00:37:26.010 --> 00:37:27.809
Take her upstairs. She was in the middle of a lesson.

00:37:31.679 --> 00:37:34.419
Let's go.

00:37:34.420 --> 00:37:35.550
Let's go.

00:37:35.749 --> 00:37:37.220
Let's go upstairs.

00:37:39.220 --> 00:37:40.289
No, you can't.

00:37:40.559 --> 00:37:42.490
Who do you think you're stopping?

00:37:42.729 --> 00:37:44.900
Pity and confession don't help.

00:37:45.130 --> 00:37:48.269
If we stop here, Chung Ah will close her mouth again.

00:37:48.999 --> 00:37:50.470
You should try to be cool-headed, Mr. Yoon.

00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:52.369
I will teach her...

00:37:52.970 --> 00:37:54.669
so that she'll be capable enough...

00:37:54.670 --> 00:37:56.269
to lead Jinsung later.

00:37:57.809 --> 00:37:58.809
Let's get going.

00:37:59.479 --> 00:38:01.308
All right? Let's go.

00:38:01.309 --> 00:38:02.849
You should go.

00:38:04.119 --> 00:38:05.220
There you go.

00:38:17.999 --> 00:38:19.199
Give me the strap.

00:38:20.699 --> 00:38:23.570
What did I say would happen when you use your hands?

00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:28.769
I said I would tie your hands.

00:38:37.780 --> 00:38:40.420
What did I tell you to do when you want something?

00:38:42.150 --> 00:38:44.990
I told you to use your mouth, not your hands.

00:38:54.070 --> 00:38:55.699
What happened here...

00:38:57.170 --> 00:38:59.769
should be kept between us. That's what I said.

00:39:00.869 --> 00:39:04.280
- Only then... - Your mom will return.

00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:33.639
(Used Books, The Day)

00:39:35.339 --> 00:39:36.779
Did you pass this place?

00:39:36.940 --> 00:39:39.080
Yes. It was late at night.

00:39:39.580 --> 00:39:41.379
There were two moons in the sky.

00:39:41.609 --> 00:39:43.179
And I was at an empty lot in Hongdae.

00:39:43.449 --> 00:39:45.279
Suddenly, La Vida Music appeared.

00:39:45.620 --> 00:39:47.318
I sold my guitar there and went out.

00:39:47.319 --> 00:39:49.420
- And you were here. - Yes.

00:39:50.319 --> 00:39:51.719
Were you at the backstreet in New York?

00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:54.830
Yes. When I left the music store, it was Gimpo Airport.

00:39:57.259 --> 00:39:59.129
We departed from different places,

00:39:59.899 --> 00:40:03.500
but arrived at the same period, year 1995.

00:40:03.870 --> 00:40:05.399
- Right. - What's this?

00:40:06.239 --> 00:40:07.969
What kind of universe is this?

00:40:08.839 --> 00:40:11.779
The two moons. La Vida Music?

00:40:12.339 --> 00:40:13.710
The instrument you sold.

00:40:14.109 --> 00:40:15.549
A suspicious Master.

00:40:15.879 --> 00:40:17.449
Year 1995.

00:40:18.379 --> 00:40:21.948
If you analyse it based on quantum physics...

00:40:21.949 --> 00:40:23.858
- You're like Sherlock. - Hey, go there...

00:40:23.859 --> 00:40:25.819
and push the bookshelf. Let's see if we can push this.

00:40:26.929 --> 00:40:27.960
I guess you're not.

00:40:31.759 --> 00:40:33.830
- It's so unfair. - What's unfair?

00:40:33.969 --> 00:40:35.499
You successfully helped your parents like each other...

00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:36.770
and prevented the accident.

00:40:36.870 --> 00:40:38.269
But I couldn't make my mom break up with my dad...

00:40:38.270 --> 00:40:39.969
and my suicide plan failed.

00:40:40.540 --> 00:40:43.278
I'm sure this time travel is favourable to you only.

00:40:43.279 --> 00:40:44.579
What do you mean it's favourable to me?

00:40:44.580 --> 00:40:45.778
You got dollars.

00:40:45.779 --> 00:40:48.809
That darn Master gave me 50,000 won bills only.

00:40:48.810 --> 00:40:51.149
I couldn't even get a single bungeoppang.

00:40:51.779 --> 00:40:53.920
Who on earth is that guy?

00:40:54.250 --> 00:40:55.488
He's either of the two.

00:40:55.489 --> 00:40:57.920
He's crazy. Or he's not in his right mind.

00:40:58.920 --> 00:41:00.589
- How are they different? - They're slightly different.

00:41:00.759 --> 00:41:01.790
You pay for this.

00:41:02.629 --> 00:41:05.759
Were all these big discussions only to decide who is going to pay?

00:41:05.859 --> 00:41:07.198
We even talked about different universes...

00:41:07.199 --> 00:41:09.399
and quantum physics.

00:41:12.100 --> 00:41:14.210
You're a successful matchmaker.

00:41:14.440 --> 00:41:15.469
But I'm...

00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:19.009
All right. It's on me.

00:41:20.250 --> 00:41:21.310
I'll pay for it,

00:41:24.350 --> 00:41:26.179
but my mission isn't completed yet.

00:41:28.219 --> 00:41:30.420
The hardest task is left.

00:41:31.759 --> 00:41:33.020
Oh, my goodness.

00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:34.890
She didn't allow a deaf person to use sign language?

00:41:35.359 --> 00:41:36.758
If it had happened in the 21st century,

00:41:36.759 --> 00:41:38.259
people on the internet would've wanted to kill her.

00:41:38.730 --> 00:41:40.429
But we're in 1995.

00:41:41.230 --> 00:41:43.299
I didn't know Chung Ah had gone through something like that.

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:47.238
So Mr. Yoon... No.

00:41:47.239 --> 00:41:49.069
You made a deal with your grandfather?

00:41:49.469 --> 00:41:50.508
Yes.

00:41:50.509 --> 00:41:52.879
You must like torturing yourself.

00:41:53.310 --> 00:41:56.210
Your time travel isn't easy as you gave yourself a new mission.

00:41:56.410 --> 00:41:57.580
It's not hard.

00:41:58.120 --> 00:42:00.120
Because I want my mom to become happy.

00:42:01.589 --> 00:42:03.819
Grandfather wants to see his daughter's smile.

00:42:04.620 --> 00:42:06.319
I think it means he wants to patch things up with her.

00:42:08.259 --> 00:42:10.129
I really want to show him.

00:42:11.060 --> 00:42:12.359
My mom's smile.

00:42:14.170 --> 00:42:15.500
It's very pretty.

00:42:17.670 --> 00:42:18.870
How about you?

00:42:19.910 --> 00:42:21.270
Did you have enough fun?

00:42:21.640 --> 00:42:23.739
Do you think your missions will be completed before going back?

00:42:24.679 --> 00:42:25.879
Well, roughly.

00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:28.609
But one thing that...

00:42:30.949 --> 00:42:31.980
Never mind.

00:42:32.179 --> 00:42:34.449
Why? Tell me. I told you everything.

00:42:34.850 --> 00:42:35.850
Later.

00:42:36.350 --> 00:42:39.420
I'll tell you when things get clearer.

00:42:41.790 --> 00:42:43.089
Let's call it a day today.

00:42:43.830 --> 00:42:44.830
I'll get going.

00:42:50.870 --> 00:42:51.968
(All kinds of literature)

00:42:51.969 --> 00:42:53.310
Welcome.

00:42:55.069 --> 00:42:56.679
Do you know a band called White Night?

00:42:57.339 --> 00:43:00.410
Of course. They were the best back in my day.

00:43:00.580 --> 00:43:03.109
Do you have a magazine that has an article about them?

00:43:03.319 --> 00:43:06.279
A very detailed one with a long article and many pictures.

00:43:12.920 --> 00:43:14.060
I'm home.

00:43:15.560 --> 00:43:17.230
You came?

00:43:32.210 --> 00:43:33.310
You came.

00:43:33.580 --> 00:43:35.679
If you have anything that needs to be dry cleaned, take them out.

00:43:35.879 --> 00:43:37.279
I think I'll be fine.

00:43:37.350 --> 00:43:39.179
Is Chung Ah in there?

00:43:39.350 --> 00:43:40.350
No.

00:43:40.589 --> 00:43:43.589
I heard she had a lesson at Professor Kim's house today.

00:44:15.719 --> 00:44:16.960
Where is she?

00:44:17.190 --> 00:44:19.119
I told you. She's at Professor Kim's house.

00:44:19.120 --> 00:44:20.359
Do you want me to report her missing?

00:44:21.089 --> 00:44:22.489
Should I get help from the police?

00:44:25.460 --> 00:44:27.870
What are you guys plotting in this house?

00:44:28.730 --> 00:44:30.399
Do you want to be an accomplice as well?

00:44:31.540 --> 00:44:32.540
Tell me.

00:44:33.040 --> 00:44:35.569
Tell me where she is right now.

00:45:00.270 --> 00:45:03.270
(Sugar)

00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:12.480
You found me.

00:45:13.449 --> 00:45:15.679
The hide-and-seek is over.

00:45:16.609 --> 00:45:17.850
After 12 years.

00:45:36.969 --> 00:45:38.699
You have a family too, Mom.

00:45:39.940 --> 00:45:41.540
A real family.

00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:46.040
Let's go.

00:45:47.210 --> 00:45:49.109
Let's go to them right now.

00:45:54.020 --> 00:45:55.690
Let's get out of here right now.

00:46:18.810 --> 00:46:19.810
Get out of our way.

00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:25.420
I told you to get out of our way.

00:46:25.580 --> 00:46:26.620
We can't.

00:46:28.390 --> 00:46:30.660
Get out of our way unless you want to get hurt.

00:46:30.960 --> 00:46:33.890
Let them go. Let's see how far they are willing to go.

00:46:35.660 --> 00:46:36.690
Eun Gyeol.

00:46:38.699 --> 00:46:42.469
Do you even know what you're doing right now?

00:46:44.540 --> 00:46:45.600
Kidnapping...

00:46:47.040 --> 00:46:48.509
is a crime.

00:46:49.540 --> 00:46:51.179
Not as bad as confinement or domestic abuse.

00:46:51.310 --> 00:46:54.410
Oh, no. You're making such horrible accusations...

00:46:54.609 --> 00:46:56.480
when there's a better word to describe it like discipline.

00:46:57.480 --> 00:46:59.620
- Does nothing scare you? - That's right.

00:47:00.549 --> 00:47:02.620
Nothing in this world scares me.

00:47:02.890 --> 00:47:04.359
And nothing can stop me.

00:47:04.890 --> 00:47:06.389
I can even start a loud protest with pickets...

00:47:06.390 --> 00:47:07.890
in front of the National Assembly.

00:47:08.230 --> 00:47:10.428
The Jinsung Family, the family known for the musical instrument company,

00:47:10.429 --> 00:47:12.460
has an adolescent abuser!

00:47:14.370 --> 00:47:17.140
Come back inside when I ask nicely.

00:47:18.469 --> 00:47:19.540
No.

00:47:20.339 --> 00:47:21.810
I won't talk to you.

00:47:25.279 --> 00:47:27.679
I'm going to settle this with the chairman.

00:47:29.109 --> 00:47:31.149
When he comes back from the business trip, tell him this.

00:47:31.949 --> 00:47:33.319
If he wants to see his daughter,

00:47:34.190 --> 00:47:35.890
he should contact me himself.

00:47:40.060 --> 00:47:41.629
Are you sure you can handle the consequences...

00:47:42.629 --> 00:47:44.259
and take responsibility for this?

00:47:45.460 --> 00:47:48.330
If you walk out that door now,

00:47:48.670 --> 00:47:50.569
you will regret it.

00:47:56.140 --> 00:47:58.410
I should be saying that to you.

00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:02.350
Starting now, I'm going to change your history.

00:48:03.879 --> 00:48:05.020
Do you think you can live in luxury?

00:48:05.649 --> 00:48:06.819
Don't even dream about it.

00:48:08.149 --> 00:48:10.690
I'll show you what it means to be punished for evils.

00:48:17.330 --> 00:48:19.399
I clearly warned you.

00:48:24.140 --> 00:48:25.739
(Snail Guesthouse)

00:48:35.109 --> 00:48:36.980
There's something we want to tell you.

00:48:40.949 --> 00:48:42.919
I mean, she ended up at a police substation.

00:48:42.920 --> 00:48:46.459
So I knew there was something when her parents didn't show up.

00:48:46.460 --> 00:48:49.528
How could a human being do something so awful like that?

00:48:49.529 --> 00:48:52.859
Gosh. What a subhuman thing to do.

00:48:54.330 --> 00:48:55.399
That's good.

00:48:56.029 --> 00:48:57.398
I'll feed her, clothe her, and give her a place to stay...

00:48:57.399 --> 00:48:59.068
even if I have to sell my underwear.

00:48:59.069 --> 00:49:00.440
Let her stay here for the time being.

00:49:01.569 --> 00:49:03.509
- Thank you. - Sure.

00:49:05.980 --> 00:49:07.009
Where are you going?

00:49:07.879 --> 00:49:08.980
To the Jinsung Family.

00:49:09.850 --> 00:49:11.778
I must make them realize what they have done.

00:49:11.779 --> 00:49:13.219
Why would you?

00:49:13.279 --> 00:49:14.849
Then should I just sit back and watch them?

00:49:14.850 --> 00:49:16.689
We're strangers to them.

00:49:16.690 --> 00:49:17.690
They're not our families.

00:49:17.691 --> 00:49:19.289
- Sit back down. - Grandma!

00:49:19.290 --> 00:49:22.059
The head of the family isn't home!

00:49:22.060 --> 00:49:24.460
He has no idea about this.

00:49:24.600 --> 00:49:26.199
What about Chung Ah?

00:49:26.799 --> 00:49:29.429
You'll end up causing a huge scene at her house and ruin everything.

00:49:29.830 --> 00:49:33.198
You need to give her some time to decide if she wants...

00:49:33.199 --> 00:49:35.810
to give her clueless father a chance or not.

00:49:38.739 --> 00:49:39.810
Hey.

00:49:40.649 --> 00:49:42.080
Let him be.

00:49:42.779 --> 00:49:46.250
He's acting like that because he's furious.

00:49:46.750 --> 00:49:48.519
He needs to let it out from time to time...

00:49:48.520 --> 00:49:50.290
not to have any resentment.

00:49:51.819 --> 00:49:54.128
He knows what's right and wrong.

00:49:54.129 --> 00:49:55.290
Just go to him...

00:49:56.190 --> 00:49:58.500
and hear him out.

00:50:00.469 --> 00:50:01.469
Okay.

00:50:07.170 --> 00:50:08.170
Yi Chan.

00:50:10.379 --> 00:50:11.480
Wait.

00:50:12.640 --> 00:50:13.679
Let go.

00:50:14.449 --> 00:50:16.379
I need to go and tell them that Chung Ah isn't alone.

00:50:17.219 --> 00:50:19.778
They must know that there are people watching them.

00:50:19.779 --> 00:50:22.250
Okay. Let's do that when the chairman comes back.

00:50:22.390 --> 00:50:23.390
Who?

00:50:24.259 --> 00:50:25.290
The money generator?

00:50:26.660 --> 00:50:28.460
He didn't care if her home became a prison.

00:50:28.660 --> 00:50:29.988
Even when his daughter was getting abused,

00:50:29.989 --> 00:50:31.330
he looked away and covered his ears.

00:50:31.629 --> 00:50:33.298
The man who's never home?

00:50:33.299 --> 00:50:35.529
- Yi Chan. - How is he any different?

00:50:37.569 --> 00:50:40.169
He's just like my father who wandered around the country...

00:50:40.170 --> 00:50:43.009
and abounded his own mother and son because he wanted to gamble!

00:50:45.140 --> 00:50:46.339
I didn't ask to be born.

00:50:47.879 --> 00:50:49.910
They didn't ask us before bringing us into the world.

00:50:51.179 --> 00:50:53.420
They can't just get off this easily after giving birth to us.

00:50:53.949 --> 00:50:56.589
They should be here, so we can blame them for having us!

00:50:56.790 --> 00:50:58.219
That's what parents do!

00:51:13.600 --> 00:51:14.609
Gosh.

00:51:15.140 --> 00:51:18.508
There are no girls in this house, but I washed them thoroughly.

00:51:18.509 --> 00:51:20.140
I'm not sure if you'll like them.

00:51:22.250 --> 00:51:25.520
Gosh. You're so pretty.

00:51:26.520 --> 00:51:28.718
Look at your eyes.

00:51:28.719 --> 00:51:30.519
How can they look so beautifully black and clear...

00:51:30.520 --> 00:51:32.290
like the wild grapes?

00:51:35.089 --> 00:51:38.199
Gosh. You must be awfully sad that you can't talk.

00:51:38.730 --> 00:51:40.229
I can't imagine how wronged and devastated...

00:51:40.230 --> 00:51:41.699
you felt all this time.

00:51:43.330 --> 00:51:46.739
But you did a great job, growing into a beautiful young lady.

00:51:47.310 --> 00:51:48.609
I'm proud of you.

00:51:50.379 --> 00:51:53.040
If anyone tries to punish you...

00:51:53.239 --> 00:51:56.979
or lock you up in the attic ever again,

00:51:56.980 --> 00:51:59.878
don't put up with it. Just run out of there.

00:51:59.879 --> 00:52:00.949
Then come here.

00:52:01.520 --> 00:52:05.020
Or you can start living with me as of today.

00:52:13.969 --> 00:52:15.929
Gosh. Oh, no.

00:52:17.370 --> 00:52:20.540
Okay. Don't cry now.

00:52:21.710 --> 00:52:23.210
I got you.

00:52:28.509 --> 00:52:31.818
Don't cry. It's okay.

00:52:31.819 --> 00:52:33.149
I have my grandma.

00:52:34.489 --> 00:52:36.420
She made it bearable for me to live.

00:52:42.259 --> 00:52:43.259
But does she...

00:52:45.759 --> 00:52:47.060
have anyone by her side?

00:52:49.170 --> 00:52:51.000
Yes, she does.

00:52:51.969 --> 00:52:55.040
You, me, Grandma,

00:52:56.569 --> 00:52:57.580
and...

00:52:58.739 --> 00:52:59.739
Eun Ho.

00:53:02.250 --> 00:53:03.350
She's a great girl.

00:53:04.279 --> 00:53:05.480
She amazes me too.

00:53:06.719 --> 00:53:09.549
She probably never got loved properly.

00:53:10.819 --> 00:53:13.259
But how could she like me so sincerely?

00:53:16.989 --> 00:53:18.100
You're amazing.

00:53:18.629 --> 00:53:20.230
You deserve to be loved too.

00:53:21.870 --> 00:53:22.969
What's with you?

00:53:23.569 --> 00:53:24.640
Do you need to borrow money from me?

00:53:27.040 --> 00:53:29.270
You will be a great parent one day.

00:53:29.940 --> 00:53:32.639
What are you talking about? I'll never get married.

00:53:32.640 --> 00:53:35.750
What? Why not? Why won't you get married?

00:53:36.649 --> 00:53:38.379
What about me then?

00:53:38.679 --> 00:53:39.980
This isn't the time to joke.

00:53:41.989 --> 00:53:43.020
I won't.

00:53:45.589 --> 00:53:47.229
I have never been loved by my parents.

00:53:47.230 --> 00:53:49.089
So I might not know how to love my own children.

00:53:50.600 --> 00:53:51.600
That scares me.

00:53:54.469 --> 00:53:56.399
That will never be the case.

00:53:57.069 --> 00:53:59.569
You will be loved by your wife...

00:53:59.699 --> 00:54:01.569
and respected by your children.

00:54:01.770 --> 00:54:04.379
You will be a cool and amazing dad.

00:54:05.009 --> 00:54:06.440
I can assure you of that.

00:54:06.540 --> 00:54:08.649
What is it? How much do you want?

00:54:11.250 --> 00:54:13.119
Let's go. Chung Ah must be waiting.

00:54:13.120 --> 00:54:15.049
She's alone. Let's stay with her.

00:54:27.699 --> 00:54:30.068
Gosh. You can't play that one.

00:54:30.069 --> 00:54:33.198
You just need one more card with the red ribbon.

00:54:33.199 --> 00:54:35.239
I told you that you could complete the set then.

00:54:36.440 --> 00:54:38.278
Hey, why don't you let that one go?

00:54:38.279 --> 00:54:40.139
Come on. Once played, it can't be taken back.

00:54:40.140 --> 00:54:41.479
If you keep pestering me like that,

00:54:41.480 --> 00:54:42.810
I'll stop here instead of calling the third Go.

00:54:43.080 --> 00:54:44.849
You ungrateful brat.

00:54:44.850 --> 00:54:46.979
Think about all the food I fed you!

00:54:46.980 --> 00:54:48.089
Just let that one go!

00:54:48.290 --> 00:54:50.719
I told you I wasn't going to play like your friends.

00:54:50.890 --> 00:54:52.119
You must follow the rules.

00:54:52.120 --> 00:54:53.620
All right. Here comes another player!

00:54:54.230 --> 00:54:57.599
- Gosh. Hey! - Oh, my! Hey.

00:54:57.600 --> 00:55:00.699
I finally digested the rice cake soup I had last year!

00:55:02.469 --> 00:55:03.769
There's nothing we can do now.

00:55:03.770 --> 00:55:05.738
- What are you doing? Come on. - I didn't do it on purpose.

00:55:05.739 --> 00:55:07.738
- It was an accident. - Come on!

00:55:07.739 --> 00:55:10.108
She said she just digested the rice cake soup!

00:55:10.109 --> 00:55:11.779
I only realized this after coming here.

00:55:14.279 --> 00:55:15.980
That my parents...

00:55:17.179 --> 00:55:19.319
also had a painful time in their youth.

00:55:20.350 --> 00:55:21.948
- Gosh. - No. This isn't right.

00:55:21.949 --> 00:55:23.718
- Let's play again. - We'll play again.

00:55:23.719 --> 00:55:25.818
- No! - My hands must have slipped.

00:55:25.819 --> 00:55:28.128
- Grandma, my hands slipped. - Right.

00:55:28.129 --> 00:55:30.599
- Gosh. What should I do? - Good job.

00:55:30.600 --> 00:55:34.629
Gosh. My grandma finally digested the rice cake soup!

00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:39.199
I also realized they had overcome the pain and suffering...

00:55:44.279 --> 00:55:46.080
to become my parents.

00:56:16.770 --> 00:56:18.409
All right. Go.

00:56:18.410 --> 00:56:19.679
("All About the Band, White Night")

00:56:22.549 --> 00:56:24.350
("Jonathan's Woman, Rookie Actress, Shin A Young")

00:56:25.620 --> 00:56:27.049
What's he like?

00:56:27.549 --> 00:56:29.919
Eun Gyeol told me that back in the day,

00:56:29.920 --> 00:56:32.419
he was a legend who ruled the band scene with just a guitar.

00:56:32.420 --> 00:56:33.489
Is that true?

00:56:34.089 --> 00:56:35.890
It's so true.

00:56:36.160 --> 00:56:37.428
You've heard of the legendary rock group,

00:56:37.429 --> 00:56:38.699
White Night, right?

00:56:39.330 --> 00:56:41.170
- You don't know them? - No.

00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:45.238
- I can't eat with you. - Why not?

00:56:45.239 --> 00:56:46.999
Was White Night that good?

00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:48.968
They were more than just "good."

00:56:48.969 --> 00:56:51.909
If they lasted 10... No. If they lasted 5 more years,

00:56:51.910 --> 00:56:53.439
they would have changed the dynamics of the band scene.

00:56:53.440 --> 00:56:54.980
That's what all the experts say.

00:56:55.580 --> 00:56:57.149
And the frontman of this band...

00:56:58.420 --> 00:56:59.520
was him.

00:56:59.879 --> 00:57:02.548
Why is a legendary guitarist grilling meat here?

00:57:02.549 --> 00:57:04.389
It's all because of the scandal.

00:57:04.390 --> 00:57:06.660
Hey, that's a rumour people who saw him as a threat made up.

00:57:06.960 --> 00:57:08.059
What scandal?

00:57:08.060 --> 00:57:10.059
Rumour has it that he fell in love with a rookie actress...

00:57:10.060 --> 00:57:12.600
and had a baby with her out of wedlock.

00:57:13.160 --> 00:57:14.199
A baby out of wedlock?

00:57:17.170 --> 00:57:19.338
Of course, his female fans stopped supporting the band.

00:57:19.339 --> 00:57:21.169
Their album stopped selling.

00:57:21.170 --> 00:57:23.839
The band crumbled, got disbanded, and retired.

00:57:24.509 --> 00:57:26.980
Even to this day, no one knows if the rumour is true or not.

00:57:27.480 --> 00:57:29.508
It was a great loss to the band scene in Korea.

00:57:29.509 --> 00:57:30.509
(Shin A Young was pregnant?)

00:57:32.149 --> 00:57:33.179
Hello.

00:57:37.989 --> 00:57:39.460
What brings you here?

00:57:44.929 --> 00:57:46.500
I want to know about my mother.

00:57:48.600 --> 00:57:49.629
The actress, Shin A Young.

00:58:40.790 --> 00:58:42.549
Press one to record a message.

00:58:44.660 --> 00:58:45.660
Ha Eun Gyeol.

00:58:46.560 --> 00:58:48.190
Why didn't you come to school today?

00:58:49.989 --> 00:58:51.600
Chung Ah wasn't at school either.

00:58:52.460 --> 00:58:54.170
Did something happen to you guys?

00:58:56.770 --> 00:58:58.140
Something did happen to me.

00:58:59.699 --> 00:59:01.739
Something crazy happened to me.

00:59:05.509 --> 00:59:06.710
You know,

00:59:08.949 --> 00:59:10.480
I think I'm getting homesick.

00:59:11.480 --> 00:59:13.679
I suddenly crave my mother's food.

00:59:19.890 --> 00:59:20.989
I'm hungry.

00:59:23.460 --> 00:59:24.960
Let's have a meal together.

00:59:25.730 --> 00:59:27.060
It's my treat today.

00:59:29.199 --> 00:59:30.699
(Soybean noodles, spicy noodles)

00:59:31.870 --> 00:59:33.040
Hello.

00:59:37.109 --> 00:59:39.079
I'm sorry, ma'am. We'll come back another time.

00:59:39.080 --> 00:59:40.379
Sure.

00:59:42.449 --> 00:59:43.878
- What is it? - Let's go.

00:59:43.879 --> 00:59:46.879
I can't get you your mother's food. So Grandma's food will have to do.

00:59:51.859 --> 00:59:53.989
So you brought her to the guesthouse?

00:59:54.390 --> 00:59:57.029
Yes. Just until the chairman comes back.

00:59:57.730 --> 00:59:59.229
You'll settle this yourself once your grandfather...

00:59:59.230 --> 01:00:00.699
comes back to Korea?

01:00:03.399 --> 01:00:05.040
I'll do my best to do so.

01:00:08.739 --> 01:00:10.810
Didn't you say something happened to you?

01:00:10.910 --> 01:00:11.980
What is it?

01:00:12.140 --> 01:00:13.140
It's nothing.

01:00:13.141 --> 01:00:15.850
You must have a lot on your mind. I don't want to add to that.

01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:17.750
What is it? Tell me.

01:00:18.279 --> 01:00:20.580
I was just hungry. That's all.

01:00:21.449 --> 01:00:22.988
Anyway, good for you.

01:00:22.989 --> 01:00:25.358
You have your parents and great-grandmother.

01:00:25.359 --> 01:00:27.160
You got the whole family at the guesthouse.

01:00:27.890 --> 01:00:28.890
Not exactly.

01:00:29.660 --> 01:00:30.959
My older brother isn't here.

01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:32.629
What? You had a brother?

01:00:32.730 --> 01:00:34.428
Didn't I tell you?

01:00:34.429 --> 01:00:36.798
I went to the gym a lot because my brother did taekwondo.

01:00:36.799 --> 01:00:38.770
I see. You did tell me that.

01:00:40.500 --> 01:00:42.940
Gosh. Am I getting homesick too?

01:00:43.540 --> 01:00:45.210
I suddenly miss him.

01:00:45.980 --> 01:00:48.548
My brother is super athletic and handsome.

01:00:48.549 --> 01:00:50.379
He's really popular among girls.

01:00:52.219 --> 01:00:54.390
Gosh. I miss you, Ha Eun Ho.

01:00:55.390 --> 01:00:56.420
Wait.

01:00:58.120 --> 01:00:59.619
What's your brother's name?

01:00:59.620 --> 01:01:01.960
It's Ha Eun Ho.

01:01:05.129 --> 01:01:06.160
What's wrong?

01:01:07.529 --> 01:01:10.100
You're Eun Ho's brother?

01:01:11.270 --> 01:01:12.640
You know my brother?

01:01:12.770 --> 01:01:14.439
Eun Ho was the one...

01:01:14.440 --> 01:01:16.109
who taught me sign language and the term, "CODA."

01:01:16.310 --> 01:01:18.540
The friend I made at the hospital when I was treated for hearing loss.

01:01:19.509 --> 01:01:21.879
(Metaphor On: Looking like an idol singer.)

01:01:22.210 --> 01:01:23.449
Hey, seriously!

01:01:24.620 --> 01:01:26.749
I bet you've got a new girlfriend.

01:01:26.750 --> 01:01:28.020
So who is it, this time?

01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:30.520
A pretty one.

01:01:32.859 --> 01:01:34.160
She attends an arts high school and plays the cello.

01:01:35.190 --> 01:01:36.259
No way.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.799
- Are you Metaphor On? - Yes.

01:01:41.429 --> 01:01:43.398
I exchanged a lot of direct messages with Eun Ho.

01:01:43.399 --> 01:01:45.500
We talked a lot through writing.

01:01:45.739 --> 01:01:47.940
It feels so weird that you're his brother.

01:01:48.069 --> 01:01:49.069
Gosh.

01:01:49.670 --> 01:01:51.440
What is it with us?

01:01:52.379 --> 01:01:54.279
How deeply are we connected?

01:01:57.779 --> 01:01:59.549
- Ha Eun Gyeol. - Yes.

01:02:00.549 --> 01:02:02.719
You said you stopped Yi Chan's accident.

01:02:03.819 --> 01:02:05.719
No. You were wrong.

01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:08.160
What do you mean?

01:02:08.489 --> 01:02:10.160
I heard something from Eun Ho.

01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:12.459
The date of Yi Chan's accident...

01:02:12.460 --> 01:02:15.600
Hey, you. Look at these two teenagers!

01:02:16.330 --> 01:02:19.370
Acting lovey-dovey out in public after playing hooky.

01:02:19.469 --> 01:02:21.139
Are you coming back from school, Yi Chan?

01:02:21.140 --> 01:02:22.439
Hello.

01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:23.440
- I'm coming back from school. - It wasn't the day...

01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:24.440
before the festival.

01:02:24.441 --> 01:02:26.310
You're really handsome.

01:02:27.140 --> 01:02:29.049
- Ma'am, you're still so beautiful. - The accident...

01:02:30.179 --> 01:02:31.580
didn't happen yet.

01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:34.249
- I'll get going now. - Okay.

01:02:34.250 --> 01:02:35.420
- Bye. - Bye.

01:03:56.199 --> 01:04:01.139
(Twinkling Watermelon)

01:04:01.140 --> 01:04:03.209
I can't pinpoint the place of the accident.

01:04:03.210 --> 01:04:06.439
But I'm certain my dad is meeting with Mr. Jonathan that day.

01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:07.539
Do you need to talk to me?

01:04:07.540 --> 01:04:09.048
Let's go and play our song to him.

01:04:09.049 --> 01:04:10.678
Let's meet with him and ask for help.

01:04:10.679 --> 01:04:12.148
Please, sir! Listen to our song!

01:04:12.149 --> 01:04:13.479
Chairman Yoon came back to Korea.

01:04:13.480 --> 01:04:14.988
Can you bring Chung Ah here?

01:04:14.989 --> 01:04:18.020
I told you, remember? You can come back anytime.

01:04:18.190 --> 01:04:20.258
Come with us to the station. We got a report.

01:04:20.259 --> 01:04:21.659
You guys aren't cops.

01:04:21.660 --> 01:04:23.528
Stop the car! Let me go!

01:04:23.529 --> 01:04:26.028
You must do whatever it takes to stay by Yi Chan's side.

01:04:26.029 --> 01:04:27.758
Son, thank you.

01:04:27.759 --> 01:04:29.830
In my next life, I'll be born as your father.
