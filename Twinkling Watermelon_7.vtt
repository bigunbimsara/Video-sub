A patient coming through. Please step aside.

00:01:24.145 --> 00:01:25.355
Please step aside. Excuse us.

00:01:25.356 --> 00:01:27.016
We have a patient. Please move.

00:01:27.385 --> 00:01:28.456
Dad.

00:01:35.426 --> 00:01:36.466
Mom.

(Incoming call)

00:02:23.645 --> 00:02:24.675
Hello?

00:02:24.676 --> 00:02:26.214
Hello, there.

00:02:26.215 --> 00:02:28.946
So are you having a pleasant trip?

00:02:29.315 --> 00:02:31.786
Come on. It was you?

00:02:31.956 --> 00:02:33.356
You scared me!

00:02:33.486 --> 00:02:35.485
You should have called me first if you were going to do this.

00:02:35.486 --> 00:02:37.386
- No, listen. I was... - Whatever.

00:02:37.525 --> 00:02:39.154
I'm doing very well.

00:02:39.155 --> 00:02:41.125
Don't ever call me again. Got it?

00:02:41.266 --> 00:02:43.095
You must be having fun,

00:02:43.495 --> 00:02:44.965
living someone else's life.

00:02:51.875 --> 00:02:54.374
Hello?

00:02:54.375 --> 00:02:57.814
Are you there? Can you hear me?

00:02:57.815 --> 00:02:59.115
Anybody there?

00:02:59.815 --> 00:03:00.975
What's this? Did she hang up on me?

00:03:00.976 --> 00:03:02.215
Darn it.

00:03:02.315 --> 00:03:03.345
That's right.

00:03:03.516 --> 00:03:05.786
I'm living someone else's life.

00:03:06.356 --> 00:03:08.786
My name is On Eun Yu.

00:03:09.655 --> 00:03:11.154
You have probably guessed it.

00:03:11.155 --> 00:03:13.726
I'm Choi Se Gyeong's daughter from the 21st century.

00:03:14.565 --> 00:03:17.166
(New York, 2013)

00:03:22.736 --> 00:03:23.736
That's me.

00:03:24.576 --> 00:03:25.636
That's my mom.

00:03:26.206 --> 00:03:28.305
I know that we're very alike.

00:03:29.775 --> 00:03:32.016
Apparently, I resembled her even more as I grew up.

00:03:33.845 --> 00:03:36.486
I took after her so much that I was practically her clone.

00:03:36.645 --> 00:03:37.685
Anyway...

00:03:45.456 --> 00:03:48.426
Excellent. The girl is a genius.

00:03:53.766 --> 00:03:55.606
That's how I became my mother's precious gem.

00:03:57.106 --> 00:03:58.236
Was I happy?

00:03:59.206 --> 00:04:00.206
Not in the slightest.

00:04:04.106 --> 00:04:05.775
- Bravo! - Bravo!

00:04:06.016 --> 00:04:08.845
As you know, a gem must shine all the time.

00:04:16.326 --> 00:04:19.495
The moment it loses its sparkle, its value will plummet.

00:04:45.755 --> 00:04:47.184
I was loved only briefly...

00:04:47.185 --> 00:04:48.385
when she needed to show off or put on a show.

00:04:49.325 --> 00:04:51.526
I was mostly locked up in my jewellery box.

00:05:06.476 --> 00:05:07.476
Hey.

00:05:14.586 --> 00:05:15.785
If my dad hadn't taken me...

00:05:15.786 --> 00:05:18.185
out of my mother's jewellery box from time to time,

00:05:18.786 --> 00:05:20.656
I would have died already.

00:05:21.656 --> 00:05:22.685
But...

00:05:23.385 --> 00:05:25.425
(Application on the Confirmation of Divorce by Consent)

00:05:25.426 --> 00:05:26.455
Eun Yu...

00:05:27.495 --> 00:05:28.896
is my daughter, so I'll raise her.

00:05:29.195 --> 00:05:30.526
I'm her father.

00:05:31.065 --> 00:05:32.995
If you want to raise her, you must stop drinking then.

00:05:35.705 --> 00:05:36.905
I already filled it out.

00:05:36.906 --> 00:05:38.205
I prayed to anyone who would listen.

00:05:38.536 --> 00:05:40.406
"Please make them stop fighting because of me."

00:05:45.916 --> 00:05:49.015
"Help me not regret that I was born." That's what I prayed.

00:05:49.286 --> 00:05:51.454
(Condolences)

00:05:51.455 --> 00:05:52.715
(Viva Music)

00:05:52.716 --> 00:05:54.255
Whose house is this?

00:05:55.255 --> 00:05:56.455
This was my father's house.

00:05:56.755 --> 00:05:58.555
But Grandpa lives in the US.

00:05:58.995 --> 00:06:00.596
Not him.

00:06:01.026 --> 00:06:02.426
He was your real grandpa.

00:06:03.396 --> 00:06:05.635
Grandpa in the US isn't my grandpa?

00:06:06.336 --> 00:06:07.365
No.

00:06:08.365 --> 00:06:11.236
I have two fathers. Jealous, are you?

00:06:12.236 --> 00:06:14.805
No. I only need one dad.

00:06:17.776 --> 00:06:18.846
You know,

00:06:19.916 --> 00:06:23.745
ever since I was a kid, I wanted my own family.

00:06:24.586 --> 00:06:26.455
A family that wasn't complicated to explain.

00:06:27.315 --> 00:06:30.055
A family I didn't have to worry about or be scared...

00:06:31.086 --> 00:06:32.896
of being abandoned by. A real family like that.

00:06:34.666 --> 00:06:37.166
You're my only family now.

00:06:37.396 --> 00:06:39.036
Dad isn't your real family?

00:06:42.135 --> 00:06:43.966
You'll stay by my side, right?

00:06:44.466 --> 00:06:46.575
You won't abandon me or leave me, right?

00:06:53.416 --> 00:06:54.416
I regretted it.

00:06:55.185 --> 00:06:58.115
I shouldn't have made that promise to her that day.

00:07:00.716 --> 00:07:04.054
(Viva Music)

00:07:04.055 --> 00:07:05.796
Like the change of the seasons,

00:07:06.055 --> 00:07:07.825
the relationship between my dad and my mother...

00:07:07.926 --> 00:07:09.325
cycled through hot and cold.

00:07:10.565 --> 00:07:12.134
They went through the cycle...

00:07:12.135 --> 00:07:13.695
of living together and getting separated like an annual event.

00:07:14.596 --> 00:07:17.735
In the end, the year I turned 18,

00:07:17.736 --> 00:07:18.935
they got a divorce.

00:07:19.976 --> 00:07:23.745
(6 years later)

00:07:31.486 --> 00:07:34.086
This is our home now. We'll live here, just the two of us.

00:07:35.825 --> 00:07:37.526
Just focus on studying music.

00:07:37.685 --> 00:07:38.825
You understand what I'm saying, right?

00:08:03.416 --> 00:08:05.885
Did she gain weight? She looks like she gained weight.

00:08:06.015 --> 00:08:07.955
Girls lose weight in college.

00:08:08.086 --> 00:08:10.054
It's normal for girls to gain weight until they finish high school.

00:08:10.055 --> 00:08:12.856
Ma'am, can you loosen up the waist a bit more?

00:08:12.955 --> 00:08:14.324
It will be uncomfortable when I perform.

00:08:14.325 --> 00:08:15.526
No. Leave it as it is.

00:08:16.565 --> 00:08:17.796
She'll lose weight pretty soon.

00:08:21.865 --> 00:08:22.906
Choi Se Gyeong?

00:08:26.375 --> 00:08:27.736
It's me.

00:08:28.005 --> 00:08:29.606
Yoon Sang A from Seowon Arts High School.

00:08:30.646 --> 00:08:32.676
The daughter of Jinsung Musical Instruments' chairman.

00:08:34.515 --> 00:08:36.245
I did hear that you were back in Korea.

00:08:36.685 --> 00:08:38.115
So it was true.

00:08:40.656 --> 00:08:43.226
No way. Is she your daughter?

00:08:43.656 --> 00:08:44.856
Hello.

00:08:45.955 --> 00:08:48.766
She's a carbon copy of you in high school.

00:08:50.296 --> 00:08:51.565
It's nice to see you.

00:08:52.036 --> 00:08:54.335
But what a pity. I have an appointment coming up soon.

00:08:55.605 --> 00:08:56.935
I heard about your news.

00:08:57.406 --> 00:08:58.605
You got divorced.

00:08:59.636 --> 00:09:01.205
I was a bit shocked.

00:09:01.235 --> 00:09:02.246
Darn it.

00:09:02.546 --> 00:09:04.815
The timer on the time bomb started to tick away.

00:09:04.916 --> 00:09:06.175
You and Ji Hwan...

00:09:06.176 --> 00:09:09.146
were the last couple I expected to see getting a divorce.

00:09:09.215 --> 00:09:10.984
- Three. - I get it, though.

00:09:10.985 --> 00:09:13.156
It was even more shocking when you got married.

00:09:13.416 --> 00:09:15.886
I thought you would continue your career as a cellist.

00:09:16.685 --> 00:09:18.295
- Two. - You were notably impressive...

00:09:18.296 --> 00:09:19.755
when you were in high school. You know?

00:09:19.756 --> 00:09:22.564
You were talented, beautiful,

00:09:22.565 --> 00:09:23.996
and popular too.

00:09:24.935 --> 00:09:27.995
Boys from other high schools worshipped you like some deity.

00:09:27.996 --> 00:09:30.006
They called you the Queen of Cello.

00:09:31.735 --> 00:09:32.776
One.

00:09:46.156 --> 00:09:47.684
I'm serious.

00:09:47.685 --> 00:09:50.485
A boy formed a band just for me.

00:09:50.985 --> 00:09:53.855
He said he would put on a show at the festival just for me.

00:09:54.555 --> 00:09:57.295
Right. Talking about bands brings back this memory.

00:09:57.296 --> 00:09:59.636
Did I tell you my first love was in a band?

00:10:01.636 --> 00:10:03.435
You see, my first love...

00:10:03.735 --> 00:10:06.006
was nothing like your father.

00:10:08.906 --> 00:10:12.616
He was bright like sunshine, cheerful, and manly.

00:10:14.246 --> 00:10:15.714
He seemed indifferent and cold from time to time,

00:10:15.715 --> 00:10:17.085
but he was kind.

00:10:17.985 --> 00:10:20.415
He was sometimes sensitive and meticulous.

00:10:20.416 --> 00:10:21.416
But he had a positive attitude.

00:10:21.417 --> 00:10:23.786
You should have married your first love.

00:10:25.026 --> 00:10:26.656
I wouldn't have been born then.

00:10:27.695 --> 00:10:28.695
What?

00:10:29.666 --> 00:10:31.396
Why don't I finish Part Two of your story?

00:10:32.435 --> 00:10:34.965
"If only I didn't marry your father..."

00:10:35.266 --> 00:10:37.406
"If only you weren't born, I would have had..."

00:10:37.565 --> 00:10:38.934
"a fantastic career as a cellist..."

00:10:38.935 --> 00:10:40.506
"and explored the world."

00:10:41.105 --> 00:10:43.145
"I wouldn't have lived as a boring woman..."

00:10:43.146 --> 00:10:45.376
"who clung on to her husband and obsessed over her daughter."

00:10:47.345 --> 00:10:49.385
Eun Yu. What I said...

00:10:49.386 --> 00:10:50.715
It was the liquor talking?

00:10:51.286 --> 00:10:52.855
You're never going to drink again?

00:10:53.185 --> 00:10:55.256
Do you expect me to fall for that promise again?

00:10:55.825 --> 00:10:58.054
Did you think I had a choice about being born?

00:10:58.055 --> 00:10:59.095
I...

00:10:59.656 --> 00:11:01.965
didn't get to choose to have you as my mother when I was born.

00:11:04.026 --> 00:11:05.166
Come on.

00:11:15.246 --> 00:11:16.676
What do you think you're doing?

00:11:16.776 --> 00:11:18.006
I'm going to live with Dad.

00:11:18.445 --> 00:11:19.775
I'm scared that...

00:11:19.776 --> 00:11:21.375
I might turn into you if I keep living with you.

00:11:21.376 --> 00:11:23.415
That's why I told you to focus only on music.

00:11:23.416 --> 00:11:24.444
So you won't turn into me!

00:11:24.445 --> 00:11:26.016
Stop giving me these excuses!

00:11:26.215 --> 00:11:28.184
Don't use me.

00:11:28.185 --> 00:11:30.756
Why must I be a tool for redeeming your failed life?

00:11:30.985 --> 00:11:32.126
I can't talk to you when you're like this.

00:11:32.996 --> 00:11:34.496
Talking was the last thing we ever did.

00:11:34.725 --> 00:11:36.365
You were always busy telling me what was on your mind.

00:11:36.366 --> 00:11:37.995
Whenever I talked, you treated me like some dog barking.

00:11:37.996 --> 00:11:40.136
Is that why you put on an act that you lost your hearing?

00:11:40.296 --> 00:11:42.635
Is that why you gave up that easily?

00:11:42.636 --> 00:11:44.204
Just to rebel against me?

00:11:44.205 --> 00:11:45.835
This is why I hate you.

00:11:46.575 --> 00:11:48.776
It's so easy for you to spit out these hurtful words.

00:11:49.046 --> 00:11:51.876
Sometimes, you act like a sociopath.

00:11:52.416 --> 00:11:54.776
Dad left because he was sick of this side of you. You know?

00:11:58.146 --> 00:11:59.315
How awful you are.

00:12:00.215 --> 00:12:03.256
You're just like your dad.

00:12:03.926 --> 00:12:04.955
You're right.

00:12:05.496 --> 00:12:07.126
I always got along with Dad much better than with you.

00:12:20.805 --> 00:12:22.876
That was the last day I spent with my mom,

00:12:26.215 --> 00:12:28.116
and it was the beginning of a long trip.

00:12:38.825 --> 00:12:41.126
(Incheon to JFK)

00:12:51.676 --> 00:12:52.835
Hello.

00:12:53.376 --> 00:12:54.406
Who are you?

00:12:54.676 --> 00:12:57.545
I'm sorry. But isn't this Dr. On's house?

00:12:57.546 --> 00:12:58.945
Yes. But who...

00:12:59.575 --> 00:13:01.916
I see. You're Dr. On's daughter.

00:13:02.746 --> 00:13:04.745
- Honey. - "Honey?"

00:13:04.746 --> 00:13:06.756
Honey, come quick. Your daughter's here.

00:13:08.016 --> 00:13:10.426
He's on the second floor, so he can't hear us.

00:13:10.526 --> 00:13:11.656
Come in, sweetie.

00:13:12.595 --> 00:13:13.595
Honey.

00:13:22.235 --> 00:13:23.266
(Dad)

00:13:24.965 --> 00:13:26.075
(Dad)

00:13:32.046 --> 00:13:33.074
Darn it.

00:13:33.075 --> 00:13:34.075
(Mom)

00:13:42.185 --> 00:13:43.386
Dang, mama.

00:13:43.656 --> 00:13:45.155
- Where are you going? - Sorry.

00:13:45.156 --> 00:13:47.595
- Do you want to hang out with us? - Sorry.

00:13:51.296 --> 00:13:52.296
Oh, shoot.

00:13:57.166 --> 00:14:00.136
They should've married other people if they were going to do this.

00:14:01.506 --> 00:14:03.506
They shouldn't have had me then.

00:14:05.046 --> 00:14:07.345
They didn't even ask me what I wanted.

00:14:08.246 --> 00:14:10.546
I had no choice in my birth.

00:14:11.116 --> 00:14:13.184
It's not like they're going to live my life for me.

00:14:13.185 --> 00:14:15.126
What is this?

00:15:52.815 --> 00:15:54.585
- Welcome. - Gosh, you startled me!

00:15:56.786 --> 00:15:58.725
I'm the master of this store.

00:15:58.955 --> 00:16:01.296
It must not have been easy to find this store.

00:16:01.426 --> 00:16:02.626
How did you find this place?

00:16:03.426 --> 00:16:06.835
No, you turned on the light for the sign just now.

00:16:08.065 --> 00:16:09.335
Yes. I did that, didn't I?

00:16:11.305 --> 00:16:13.335
Would you like a warm cup of tea?

00:16:13.475 --> 00:16:15.344
No, I'm good with tea.

00:16:15.345 --> 00:16:17.746
Do you buy used cellos?

00:16:17.906 --> 00:16:18.945
I want to sell it.

00:16:24.815 --> 00:16:26.455
Are you sure you want to sell this?

00:16:27.185 --> 00:16:29.325
I can tell you treated this cello with a lot of care.

00:16:30.455 --> 00:16:31.926
I don't need it anymore.

00:16:32.756 --> 00:16:34.256
I'm going to die soon.

00:16:34.455 --> 00:16:35.525
Oh, no.

00:16:35.526 --> 00:16:37.996
You're still very young. What made you become suicidal?

00:16:40.835 --> 00:16:43.565
Carrying that huge cello on my back...

00:16:43.766 --> 00:16:45.536
is way too heavy.

00:16:47.776 --> 00:16:49.104
But the cello doesn't seem...

00:16:49.105 --> 00:16:50.975
heavy enough to make someone suicidal.

00:16:52.776 --> 00:16:54.746
You can't probably see her,

00:16:54.945 --> 00:16:57.685
- but my mom is on that cello. - Oh, my.

00:16:58.815 --> 00:17:01.155
Dad used to bring her down from the cello once in a while.

00:17:01.156 --> 00:17:02.656
But he's not interested in doing that anymore.

00:17:03.126 --> 00:17:05.156
So I think I'm ready to end my life.

00:17:05.426 --> 00:17:07.695
Your parents will be very sad.

00:17:07.825 --> 00:17:09.194
People say children fulfill a lifetime of duty...

00:17:09.195 --> 00:17:10.765
when they hit the age of three.

00:17:10.766 --> 00:17:12.396
It's not a bad deal for everyone.

00:17:12.935 --> 00:17:15.564
I'll have fun with the money from selling the cello.

00:17:15.565 --> 00:17:16.636
Then I'll die.

00:17:19.535 --> 00:17:20.606
Great!

00:17:21.005 --> 00:17:24.745
I will give you a very good price just for you.

00:17:28.245 --> 00:17:29.285
Gosh.

00:17:32.485 --> 00:17:33.715
Are you sure you're giving me a good price?

00:17:33.755 --> 00:17:35.356
I only see one-dollar bills.

00:17:36.485 --> 00:17:38.625
This will come in handy more than you think.

00:17:38.626 --> 00:17:39.725
Did you know?

00:17:40.156 --> 00:17:41.855
The design of one-dollar bills...

00:17:41.856 --> 00:17:44.495
has never changed unlike other bills.

00:17:49.866 --> 00:17:51.336
Here. Take this...

00:17:51.535 --> 00:17:54.675
in case you want to get your cello back.

00:17:54.676 --> 00:17:56.205
That will never happen.

00:17:58.045 --> 00:18:00.745
Take it just in case.

00:18:01.275 --> 00:18:02.285
Okay.

00:18:05.785 --> 00:18:08.015
Why don't you go on a trip before you die?

00:18:09.926 --> 00:18:11.955
I mean, it will be a special trip.

00:18:15.795 --> 00:18:16.795
Sounds good.

00:18:17.295 --> 00:18:19.836
It'll give me time to think about my suicidal plan. I'll do that.

00:18:21.066 --> 00:18:23.435
Thank you for the tea.

00:18:26.636 --> 00:18:28.435
Watch your way out.

00:18:29.705 --> 00:18:30.775
Okay.

00:18:32.045 --> 00:18:34.515
I hope you have a pleasant trip.

00:18:54.096 --> 00:18:55.136
What?

00:18:56.836 --> 00:18:57.905
(Entrance)

00:18:57.906 --> 00:18:59.005
What's this?

00:18:59.205 --> 00:19:00.534
This is an airport.

00:19:00.535 --> 00:19:02.045
(International Arrivals)

00:19:02.306 --> 00:19:03.376
An airport in Korea at that.

00:19:07.346 --> 00:19:08.646
(Who paged me?)

00:19:11.685 --> 00:19:12.685
What?

00:19:18.656 --> 00:19:20.356
"Year 1995?"

00:19:22.096 --> 00:19:24.265
Why don't you go on a trip before you die?

00:19:25.066 --> 00:19:26.896
I mean, it will be a special trip.

00:19:27.995 --> 00:19:30.136
And it was time travel?

00:19:30.735 --> 00:19:31.765
My gosh.

00:19:32.906 --> 00:19:33.935
Se Gyeong.

00:19:34.005 --> 00:19:35.846
Aren't you Se Gyeong?

00:19:36.205 --> 00:19:38.876
You are, right? I'm Kim Min Ji.

00:19:39.045 --> 00:19:41.545
We were classmates in sixth grade at Lala Elementary School.

00:19:42.285 --> 00:19:45.146
- Oh, yes. Min Ji. - Yes, that's me.

00:19:45.215 --> 00:19:48.386
I heard you had left Korea to study abroad a few days ago.

00:19:48.556 --> 00:19:49.556
Did you not?

00:19:49.656 --> 00:19:51.355
- Abroad? - Yes.

00:19:51.356 --> 00:19:52.356
Wait.

00:19:52.455 --> 00:19:54.856
So it's around when Mom just left Korea to study abroad.

00:19:55.195 --> 00:19:56.396
If so...

00:20:07.806 --> 00:20:10.045
It means this house will be empty for a while.

00:20:13.116 --> 00:20:16.244
So did you give up on dying now?

00:20:16.245 --> 00:20:17.514
(Daehan Telecommunication)

00:20:17.515 --> 00:20:19.285
Of course, I didn't.

00:20:19.356 --> 00:20:23.386
You just said you were doing well, didn't you?

00:20:23.556 --> 00:20:25.225
I am doing well.

00:20:25.826 --> 00:20:29.195
Because I found the most peaceful and fun way to take my own life.

00:20:29.566 --> 00:20:31.765
Gosh, can I ask what it is?

00:20:32.995 --> 00:20:35.194
It's not scary or painful.

00:20:35.195 --> 00:20:37.165
I won't have to bother anyone.

00:20:37.166 --> 00:20:39.906
And I will go out of existence very naturally.

00:20:40.775 --> 00:20:43.005
The suspense is killing me. Can you tell me more?

00:20:43.076 --> 00:20:45.376
I'm going to find my mom's first love so that they can stay together.

00:20:45.876 --> 00:20:48.244
Then she won't marry my dad.

00:20:48.245 --> 00:20:50.214
And I won't be born,

00:20:50.215 --> 00:20:52.616
which means I won't have to try hard to kill myself.

00:20:53.116 --> 00:20:54.916
Oh, my gosh.

00:20:55.386 --> 00:20:56.856
That's very creative.

00:20:56.955 --> 00:20:59.224
And my mom will be happier than she is now.

00:20:59.225 --> 00:21:01.356
Because she'll be with her first love as she wished.

00:21:02.295 --> 00:21:05.225
It's the most reasonable and elegant way to take my own life.

00:21:05.326 --> 00:21:06.896
Gosh, she's smart.

00:21:07.295 --> 00:21:09.365
That's very true.

00:21:09.366 --> 00:21:11.565
But how are you going to find her first love?

00:21:11.566 --> 00:21:13.435
- I already did. - Oh, my gosh.

00:21:14.005 --> 00:21:16.306
Gosh, you're fast.

00:21:18.846 --> 00:21:21.745
But are you sure that it's him?

00:21:23.985 --> 00:21:27.116
Well... Are you saying that he isn't?

00:21:27.816 --> 00:21:28.826
I'm not sure.

00:21:29.525 --> 00:21:30.656
What do you think?

00:21:31.426 --> 00:21:32.426
Then...

00:21:33.525 --> 00:21:35.295
I'll get back to you in good time.

00:21:36.265 --> 00:21:38.125
Viva la Vida.

00:21:38.126 --> 00:21:39.896
Hold on. Mister.

00:21:39.995 --> 00:21:41.465
Darn it. Hello?

00:21:42.096 --> 00:21:43.106
Hello?

00:21:52.045 --> 00:21:53.676
Does it mean that Mom's first love...

00:21:54.676 --> 00:21:56.545
might not be Yi Chan?

00:21:58.316 --> 00:22:00.086
Then who on earth is it?

00:22:22.705 --> 00:22:23.744
He's a patient with an electric shock.

00:22:23.745 --> 00:22:25.406
He was in a semi-coma on the way.

00:22:25.576 --> 00:22:26.944
His blood pressure has been decreasing.

00:22:26.945 --> 00:22:28.575
His pulse rate is less than 30 beats per minute,

00:22:28.576 --> 00:22:29.616
developing bradycardia.

00:22:30.015 --> 00:22:32.514
- Give him epinephrine right now. - Yes, sir.

00:22:32.515 --> 00:22:34.284
And prepare the intubation set immediately.

00:22:34.285 --> 00:22:35.316
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

00:22:37.156 --> 00:22:38.184
He's in cardiac arrest.

00:22:38.185 --> 00:22:40.294
Do CPR. Hurry up and get the defibrillator.

00:22:40.295 --> 00:22:41.325
- Hurry up. - Coming, sir.

00:22:41.326 --> 00:22:42.495
Charge 200 joules.

00:22:43.225 --> 00:22:44.366
Charge 200 joules. It's on.

00:22:44.465 --> 00:22:46.135
Please step back, everyone.

00:22:46.136 --> 00:22:47.596
Ready. Shoot.

00:22:49.306 --> 00:22:51.566
Mom. Dad.

00:22:53.035 --> 00:22:54.435
I want to go home.

00:22:57.406 --> 00:22:58.846
Please come and take me.

00:23:00.116 --> 00:23:01.146
Please.

00:23:07.185 --> 00:23:08.215
Are you okay?

00:23:12.525 --> 00:23:13.596
Oh, gosh.

00:23:13.896 --> 00:23:15.255
You're in a hospital.

00:23:15.525 --> 00:23:17.096
Hold on.

00:23:28.906 --> 00:23:31.445
You're in a hospital. You collapsed.

00:23:32.146 --> 00:23:33.146
Do you remember?

00:23:36.985 --> 00:23:39.215
What's the matter? Are you all right?

00:23:43.755 --> 00:23:44.926
It seems you remember.

00:23:45.455 --> 00:23:46.525
It's a relief.

00:23:47.025 --> 00:23:48.396
Just a second.

00:24:02.745 --> 00:24:04.076
I'm sorry I got mad at you last time.

00:24:04.646 --> 00:24:05.945
I'm sorry for the harsh words.

00:24:06.676 --> 00:24:08.816
I didn't know that you couldn't hear.

00:24:11.445 --> 00:24:12.484
I'm sorry.

00:24:12.485 --> 00:24:14.015
Don't be mistaken, Yoon Chung Ah.

00:24:14.485 --> 00:24:16.586
He's not being kind. He's pitying me.

00:24:17.225 --> 00:24:19.426
Do you think he would've been this kind...

00:24:19.556 --> 00:24:21.225
if I hadn't lost hearing?

00:24:21.426 --> 00:24:23.495
No, you can't.

00:24:24.025 --> 00:24:25.225
Don't move.

00:24:26.636 --> 00:24:27.666
You should lie down. That's what they said.

00:24:28.535 --> 00:24:31.035
They said you needed a rest.

00:24:31.306 --> 00:24:33.774
Excuse me. Can you come for a moment?

00:24:33.775 --> 00:24:34.836
Sure.

00:24:35.275 --> 00:24:37.275
I'll be back soon.

00:24:46.955 --> 00:24:48.714
(Hospital Discharge Form)

00:24:48.715 --> 00:24:50.886
(Relationship)

00:24:56.126 --> 00:24:57.765
(Friend)

00:24:58.795 --> 00:24:59.795
Here it is.

00:25:00.866 --> 00:25:03.535
Go to the reception to get a prescription for the patient.

00:25:03.735 --> 00:25:05.875
Make sure to stop by the pharmacy in the basement...

00:25:05.876 --> 00:25:07.004
to get the medication before leaving the hospital.

00:25:07.005 --> 00:25:09.346
All right. Thank you. Have a good day.

00:25:11.176 --> 00:25:12.205
My gosh.

00:25:23.525 --> 00:25:25.426
The invitation I gave you at that time.

00:25:26.295 --> 00:25:28.025
It was what Se Gyeong had given to me.

00:25:29.166 --> 00:25:32.195
I didn't know that she had put a letter in it.

00:25:33.096 --> 00:25:36.765
I'm asking why you screwed me up with this fake letter.

00:25:40.636 --> 00:25:42.406
I might not see you ever again,

00:25:42.806 --> 00:25:44.205
but I wanted to clarify the misunderstanding.

00:25:44.975 --> 00:25:46.616
Thank you for taking me to the hospital.

00:25:49.846 --> 00:25:50.846
(Yeonnam Hospital)

00:25:59.056 --> 00:26:00.356
(Please give me a chance to apologize.)

00:26:00.725 --> 00:26:02.056
Please give me a chance to apologize.

00:26:04.265 --> 00:26:05.295
Don't.

00:26:06.765 --> 00:26:07.896
I'm sorry that I misunderstood you.

00:26:10.906 --> 00:26:11.965
I'm really sorry.

00:26:12.735 --> 00:26:14.435
Don't keep apologizing like that.

00:26:15.376 --> 00:26:16.406
Aren't you hungry?

00:26:17.445 --> 00:26:18.646
Do you want to grab something?

00:26:19.346 --> 00:26:20.816
You need to eat to take your medication.

00:26:21.146 --> 00:26:22.545
Don't be so kind.

00:26:23.646 --> 00:26:24.745
You don't know.

00:26:25.316 --> 00:26:27.685
That too much kindness can hurt someone.

00:26:29.725 --> 00:26:31.755
Why? You can't forgive me?

00:26:32.025 --> 00:26:33.356
Do you think you'll never forgive me?

00:26:33.755 --> 00:26:36.866
How about you think about it while eating first?

00:26:37.225 --> 00:26:38.265
Aren't you hungry?

00:26:45.066 --> 00:26:46.275
I'm not hungry.

00:26:55.715 --> 00:26:57.015
You are hungry.

00:26:59.086 --> 00:27:02.215
No. I'm sorry. It's because I'm hungry.

00:27:02.386 --> 00:27:03.685
It's because I'm hungry.

00:27:04.656 --> 00:27:07.556
I paid the hospital bills.

00:27:08.255 --> 00:27:09.826
You pay for the meal.

00:27:28.545 --> 00:27:31.745
(On-the-spot Tteokbokki)

00:27:55.836 --> 00:27:57.505
Did you come to see me that day?

00:27:57.945 --> 00:27:59.846
Did you need my help?

00:28:00.876 --> 00:28:01.916
Help?

00:28:04.945 --> 00:28:06.485
Give me an SOS when you need help.

00:28:07.616 --> 00:28:09.255
I'll go with the guys who study sports in college.

00:28:15.295 --> 00:28:16.396
I'm relieved if it wasn't the case.

00:28:25.066 --> 00:28:26.676
(Did you come to see me that day?)

00:28:27.376 --> 00:28:28.376
Right.

00:28:29.876 --> 00:28:31.705
This is my fax number.

00:28:32.076 --> 00:28:35.275
If something happens, fax me at this number.

00:28:37.245 --> 00:28:39.886
If it's an emergency,

00:28:41.356 --> 00:28:43.254
page me first.

00:28:43.255 --> 00:28:45.386
Send "8282" or "505."

00:28:46.225 --> 00:28:47.396
Then I'll check right away.

00:28:48.126 --> 00:28:49.195
Okay?

00:28:57.636 --> 00:28:58.705
My heart...

00:28:59.636 --> 00:29:02.106
is fluttering again.

00:29:16.255 --> 00:29:19.396
Oh, do you want to part ways here?

00:29:20.725 --> 00:29:22.626
Will you be all right though?

00:29:24.495 --> 00:29:25.566
I mean, can you...

00:29:26.336 --> 00:29:29.096
go home by yourself?

00:29:32.106 --> 00:29:33.106
Right.

00:29:33.475 --> 00:29:37.045
I shouldn't insist on going to your place just because you aren't well.

00:29:38.076 --> 00:29:39.145
All right, then.

00:29:39.146 --> 00:29:42.646
Make sure you eat a lot.

00:29:43.215 --> 00:29:45.445
And don't forget...

00:29:46.856 --> 00:29:49.086
to take your medicine after each meal.

00:29:49.185 --> 00:29:51.126
I hope you recover soon...

00:29:51.955 --> 00:29:55.525
and become super healthy again.

00:29:59.935 --> 00:30:01.035
You smiled for the first time.

00:30:04.106 --> 00:30:06.775
Oh, it's nothing. Get home safely, then.

00:30:12.745 --> 00:30:15.146
Dad, you're supposed to be in love with Yoon Chung Ah!

00:30:15.346 --> 00:30:17.045
Wait, hold on.

00:30:17.445 --> 00:30:18.745
Do you know Ha Eun Gyeol?

00:30:19.356 --> 00:30:21.316
Oh, sorry. One moment.

00:30:29.626 --> 00:30:30.765
I see.

00:30:32.965 --> 00:30:34.235
That's right.

00:30:34.765 --> 00:30:36.606
We had a meal together,

00:30:37.136 --> 00:30:38.366
so we're friends now.

00:30:39.535 --> 00:30:41.775

He called...

00:31:25.015 --> 00:31:26.185
my name.

00:31:36.626 --> 00:31:38.225

Hey, Ha Eun Gyeol!

00:32:10.426 --> 00:32:12.126
You mentioned someone named Yoon Chung Ah.

00:32:13.535 --> 00:32:15.035
Why am I supposed to be in love with...

00:32:23.076 --> 00:32:24.705
He didn't come home again? What's with this guy?

00:32:33.985 --> 00:32:35.056
My gosh.

Gosh, I need some clues.

00:32:54.775 --> 00:32:56.705
Some tell tale clues.

00:32:58.146 --> 00:32:59.915
My first love was...

00:32:59.916 --> 00:33:02.815
bright like sunshine and cheerful.

00:33:02.816 --> 00:33:04.385
He seemed like a tough guy,

00:33:04.386 --> 00:33:06.145
but he always liked me and no one else.

00:33:06.146 --> 00:33:07.155
(A hopeless slacker)

00:33:07.156 --> 00:33:09.086
He seemed indifferent and cold from time to time,

00:33:09.656 --> 00:33:11.555
but he was kind.

00:33:11.556 --> 00:33:12.825
(A hopeless slacker)

00:33:12.826 --> 00:33:14.825
He was sometimes sensitive,

00:33:14.826 --> 00:33:16.465
but he had a positive attitude.

00:33:17.795 --> 00:33:18.964
Darn it.

00:33:18.965 --> 00:33:21.194

Oh, that's right. He was very good at eating spicy food.

00:33:30.775 --> 00:33:32.445
I couldn't handle spicy food at all.

00:33:33.146 --> 00:33:36.846
Once, I saw him eat something as if it wasn't spicy at all,

00:33:36.945 --> 00:33:38.846
so I stole a bite.

00:33:40.685 --> 00:33:43.724
My mouth and throat were on fire.

00:33:43.725 --> 00:33:45.126

00:33:54.235 --> 00:33:56.965
Eureka. It'll help me find out who he is, like a litmus test.

00:39:13.016 --> 00:39:15.315
That was a good one. You have good taste in men.

00:39:16.415 --> 00:39:19.085
I guess I had been looking at you through coloured glasses.

00:39:19.326 --> 00:39:21.895
You mean, like you're doing now?

00:39:22.855 --> 00:39:23.894
Hyun Yul.

00:39:23.895 --> 00:39:26.664
I heard the spicy chicken feet dish here was very good.

00:39:26.665 --> 00:39:27.665
Try it.

00:39:28.436 --> 00:39:31.734
All right. Since you're practically begging me, I shall try it.

00:39:31.735 --> 00:39:33.105
But just know this.

00:39:33.406 --> 00:39:35.136
I'm not that easy.

00:39:35.375 --> 00:39:37.476
Okay. Try it.

00:39:48.355 --> 00:39:51.255
Oh, this one has potential.

00:39:54.755 --> 00:39:56.426
What's wrong? Is it too spicy?

00:39:57.366 --> 00:39:58.496
You can't eat it?

00:39:59.965 --> 00:40:01.195
Let me warn you.

00:40:02.065 --> 00:40:04.065
If you have a hidden agenda, give up already.

00:40:04.436 --> 00:40:05.866
I like older women.

00:40:06.065 --> 00:40:07.136
Besides,

00:40:07.735 --> 00:40:09.774
I have no interest in stealing my friend's girlfriend.

00:40:09.775 --> 00:40:11.206
If I could,

00:40:11.806 --> 00:40:14.575
I'd serve in the military for them. That's how much I love them.

00:40:14.576 --> 00:40:17.144
My gosh. You mean, you love Yi Chan that much?

00:40:17.145 --> 00:40:18.686
No, my older lady friends.

00:40:19.116 --> 00:40:20.286
(Bluffer, Kang Hyun Yul)

00:40:21.786 --> 00:40:23.585
Are these two the only ones left?

00:40:24.726 --> 00:40:27.156
One of them likes men.

00:40:28.295 --> 00:40:31.426
So I'm 99 percent sure that it's Ha Yi Chan.

00:40:31.596 --> 00:40:33.835
But if it's not him...

00:40:34.965 --> 00:40:36.806
Then it means I got this whole thing wrong.

00:40:37.766 --> 00:40:39.806
Gosh, that wouldn't be good.

00:40:42.136 --> 00:40:43.505
Ha Yi Chan, you got this.

00:40:44.476 --> 00:40:46.605
- Here's your soft tofu stew. - Thank you.

00:40:47.375 --> 00:40:48.375
Thank you.

00:40:48.376 --> 00:40:49.874
Ladies first.

00:40:49.875 --> 00:40:51.815
- Thanks. - My gosh. Thank you.

00:40:51.915 --> 00:40:54.885
Excuse me. Could I get extra chilli powder and chilli peppers?

00:40:54.886 --> 00:40:56.084
- Sure. - Thank you!

00:40:56.085 --> 00:40:57.355
I knew it. It's you.

00:40:58.525 --> 00:40:59.585
Here.

00:40:59.625 --> 00:41:00.956
Oh, thank you!

00:41:01.226 --> 00:41:03.125
- Have a nice day! - Thank you. Enjoy.

00:41:03.895 --> 00:41:05.525
- You'll put the whole thing in? - Yes.

00:41:06.695 --> 00:41:08.235
About this much? That will do.

00:41:17.476 --> 00:41:18.476
Oh, my.

00:41:18.676 --> 00:41:21.846
My gosh. I don't even see a single drop of sweat.

00:41:27.755 --> 00:41:28.956
Se Gyeong, aren't you eating too?

00:41:29.156 --> 00:41:31.155
What? Oh, yes. I should eat too.

00:41:31.156 --> 00:41:32.426
- Eat up. - Okay.

00:41:34.255 --> 00:41:35.255
Hold on.

00:41:36.056 --> 00:41:37.795
Shall I check, just to be sure?

00:41:38.625 --> 00:41:41.295
By the way, what happened to your sidekick?

00:41:41.936 --> 00:41:42.996
My sidekick?

00:41:43.165 --> 00:41:44.735
Your live-in tutor.

00:41:45.036 --> 00:41:46.875
He wasn't annoying you today, telling you what to do?

00:41:48.005 --> 00:41:49.275
He left.

00:41:49.375 --> 00:41:51.005
What? He left?

00:41:51.346 --> 00:41:52.875
That do-gooder packed up and left? Why?

00:41:52.945 --> 00:41:54.215
I have no idea.

00:41:54.315 --> 00:41:56.815
I really can't figure out what upset him.

00:41:58.016 --> 00:42:00.016
He lashed out at me and left.

00:42:00.855 --> 00:42:02.286
But he has no place to go.

00:42:05.056 --> 00:42:06.355
You're worried about him, aren't you?

00:42:07.525 --> 00:42:08.556
"Worried?"

00:42:09.156 --> 00:42:10.366
Who? Me?

00:42:10.565 --> 00:42:11.665
I'm worried about Ha Eun Gyeol?

00:42:12.965 --> 00:42:13.965
Why would I worry about him?

00:42:13.966 --> 00:42:16.906
I feel like I finally removed something stuck between my teeth.

00:42:17.906 --> 00:42:19.105
Try scratching your head.

00:42:20.076 --> 00:42:22.505
- My head? Why? - Just do it. Scratch it.

00:42:23.706 --> 00:42:26.915
Oh, I guess he'll be back soon. You're scratching your forehead.

00:42:27.315 --> 00:42:28.875
Why? What does this mean?

00:42:29.076 --> 00:42:30.415
It's like a biometric navigator.

00:42:30.645 --> 00:42:33.345
When you're waiting for someone, your body knows.

00:42:33.346 --> 00:42:36.385
Scratching the back of your head means he won't be back for a while.

00:42:36.386 --> 00:42:38.656
Scratching the forehead means he'll be back very soon.

00:42:42.025 --> 00:42:43.726
Don't worry. He'll be back soon.

00:42:46.496 --> 00:42:48.665
Thanks for trying to comfort me.

00:42:49.795 --> 00:42:51.565
- Let's eat before it gets cold. - Okay.

00:43:02.645 --> 00:43:04.885
- Gosh, it's so spicy. - Is it too spicy for you?

00:43:04.886 --> 00:43:06.984
- Drink this. This helps. - It's so spicy.

00:43:06.985 --> 00:43:08.156
Drink up.

00:43:09.156 --> 00:43:10.755
Hey, you drank from this earlier.

00:43:11.556 --> 00:43:13.354
Spit it out. Here.

00:43:13.355 --> 00:43:14.926
- Here are some tissues. - Stop it.

00:43:15.426 --> 00:43:16.726
(Ha Eun Gyeol)

00:43:25.005 --> 00:43:27.176
I didn't double-check, and it bothers me.

00:43:30.005 --> 00:43:31.045
That's right.

00:43:37.145 --> 00:43:38.286
(A hopeless slacker)

00:43:39.215 --> 00:43:40.315
Here it is.

00:43:45.326 --> 00:43:46.625
Oh, here's another one.

00:43:46.656 --> 00:43:47.855
(Ha Yi Chan)

00:43:53.326 --> 00:43:54.866
(Ha Yi Chan)

00:43:54.996 --> 00:43:56.536
Oh, my.

00:43:59.406 --> 00:44:01.806
He loves him more than I thought.

00:44:02.906 --> 00:44:05.144
I knew it. So it's not you.

00:44:05.145 --> 00:44:06.346
(Ha Eun Gyeol)

00:44:07.076 --> 00:44:08.616
Do you like me?

00:44:09.275 --> 00:44:10.286
Hey.

00:44:12.686 --> 00:44:14.056
Be honest with me.

00:44:16.815 --> 00:44:18.325
Is it me?

00:44:18.326 --> 00:44:20.726
Or is it Yi Chan?

00:44:27.335 --> 00:44:28.395
Hey, you.

00:44:29.065 --> 00:44:30.235
You're dangerous.

00:44:30.906 --> 00:44:32.936
You have a way of making my heart flutter.

00:44:37.275 --> 00:44:39.206
My gosh. You're challenging me.

00:44:40.105 --> 00:44:41.375
Shall I take this off or not?

00:44:44.815 --> 00:44:46.045
Shall I take it off?

00:44:47.085 --> 00:44:48.085
Or not?

00:44:57.525 --> 00:44:59.164
(Snail Guesthouse)

00:44:59.165 --> 00:45:00.165
I'm home.

00:45:10.206 --> 00:45:11.875
Hey, Ha Eun Gyeol! Eun Gyeol!

00:45:12.246 --> 00:45:13.275
Hey, you.

00:45:20.315 --> 00:45:22.656
Hey! You brat.

00:45:22.886 --> 00:45:25.055
What about Eun Gyeol? He's not coming back?

00:45:25.056 --> 00:45:26.125
Whatever.

00:45:26.585 --> 00:45:28.225
If you want him, you go and look for him.

00:45:28.226 --> 00:45:30.225
You can't reach him? You don't know where he is?

00:45:30.226 --> 00:45:31.525
Will he be back today?

00:45:31.726 --> 00:45:34.465
Shoot. I have to do the fitting today.

00:45:34.636 --> 00:45:37.135
"Fitting?" What do you mean?

00:45:37.136 --> 00:45:38.505
Eun Gyeol didn't tell you?

00:45:38.706 --> 00:45:40.834
I agreed to be the judge for his battle...

00:45:40.835 --> 00:45:42.136
because he said he'd be my model.

00:45:42.375 --> 00:45:44.275
- "Judge for his battle?" - Yes.

00:45:44.476 --> 00:45:47.516
They told me to bring a judge if I wanted a battle with them.

00:45:47.746 --> 00:45:51.544
Okay, but why are you asking me?

00:45:51.545 --> 00:45:53.815
You said Yi Chan got into music because of you.

00:45:55.085 --> 00:45:56.714
Well, that's right.

00:45:56.715 --> 00:45:59.156
And Yoon Dong Jin became a guitarist thanks to you.

00:46:00.295 --> 00:46:03.355
Right. That is true,

00:46:04.565 --> 00:46:05.766
but I'm a little busy these days.

00:46:06.065 --> 00:46:08.735
As you can see, my presentation is right around the corner,

00:46:08.895 --> 00:46:10.665
so I have to finish up my design...

00:46:10.706 --> 00:46:12.435
and submit my assignment too.

00:46:12.436 --> 00:46:13.775
I'll take care of it for you.

00:46:14.136 --> 00:46:15.335
- What? - Well...

00:46:15.706 --> 00:46:17.604
If you have an assignment or need to do research,

00:46:17.605 --> 00:46:18.705
or if you need an assistant,

00:46:18.706 --> 00:46:19.806
just tell me.

00:46:19.945 --> 00:46:23.115
Goodness. Hey. It may seem easy,

00:46:23.116 --> 00:46:25.445
but you can't do it unless you're a fashion design major.

00:46:27.116 --> 00:46:28.815
This battle has to happen no matter what, Bal San.

00:46:29.915 --> 00:46:31.225
I promised Yi Chan that his band...

00:46:31.226 --> 00:46:33.085
would be ready to rock and roll before the festival.

00:46:33.625 --> 00:46:34.656
So please.

00:46:35.625 --> 00:46:37.895
Please help me out.

00:46:38.795 --> 00:46:39.795
So?

00:46:40.565 --> 00:46:42.834
You said you'd be a judge, and he did your assignment for you?

00:46:42.835 --> 00:46:44.605
Hey, get this.

00:46:44.835 --> 00:46:46.165
I got an A plus on the assignment...

00:46:46.706 --> 00:46:48.605
even though my professor is extremely fussy.

00:46:49.706 --> 00:46:50.746
So?

00:46:52.275 --> 00:46:54.275
You're going to make him wear this?

00:46:54.415 --> 00:46:56.245
- Yes. - To make people laugh?

00:46:56.246 --> 00:46:59.286
No. I want him to be my model at my presentation.

00:46:59.346 --> 00:47:00.385
What is this, a penalty?

00:47:00.386 --> 00:47:02.055
Have you got a death wish?

00:47:02.056 --> 00:47:03.955
Darn you. He's a good-looking guy.

00:47:03.956 --> 00:47:06.624
Must you make him wear this hideous outfit? He'll be embarrassed.

00:47:06.625 --> 00:47:08.254
Hey, it's a fair deal!

00:47:08.255 --> 00:47:09.725
Fair, my foot.

00:47:09.726 --> 00:47:11.064
The battle is over now.

00:47:11.065 --> 00:47:12.395
So is your deal.

00:47:12.665 --> 00:47:14.335
Why do you keep making him do things for free?

00:47:14.795 --> 00:47:16.935
Hey, what do you mean he's doing this for free?

00:47:16.936 --> 00:47:18.734
I paid him fairly...

00:47:18.735 --> 00:47:21.775
for his labour. This is like his part-time job!

00:47:22.235 --> 00:47:24.676
"Part-time job?" You paid him fairly?

00:47:24.875 --> 00:47:26.246
Hey, didn't you know?

00:47:26.806 --> 00:47:28.616
Eun Gyeol took on a side gig at the guesthouse.

00:47:28.846 --> 00:47:31.045
What? When?

00:47:35.786 --> 00:47:37.625
You know, I heard you helped Bal San...

00:47:38.125 --> 00:47:39.656
get an A plus.

00:47:40.656 --> 00:47:42.695
Can you help me too?

00:47:42.956 --> 00:47:46.365
Oh, that. I had to help him because I had a bit of a situation.

00:47:46.366 --> 00:47:48.265
It's just a short essay.

00:47:48.266 --> 00:47:49.995
About 8 to 10 pages.

00:47:49.996 --> 00:47:52.234
It's part of the course too. I suggest you write it yourself.

00:47:52.235 --> 00:47:53.406
You sure know how to negotiate.

00:47:54.375 --> 00:47:56.636
Okay. How about a dollar per page?

00:47:57.105 --> 00:47:58.105
Deal?

00:47:59.775 --> 00:48:01.944
Then I'll write ten pages. Deal?

00:48:01.945 --> 00:48:02.976
We have a deal.

00:48:05.645 --> 00:48:07.785
Department of Mathematics...

00:48:07.786 --> 00:48:09.386
(Essay on Popular Culture)

00:48:15.926 --> 00:48:16.956
One moment.

00:48:20.766 --> 00:48:22.366
- Jung Young Woo. - Yes.

00:48:22.695 --> 00:48:23.695
Kim Se Young.

00:48:24.806 --> 00:48:26.565
- Hong Chang Soo. - Yes.

00:48:31.505 --> 00:48:32.505
Count them and check.

00:48:51.665 --> 00:48:53.595
He's that greedy for money?

00:48:53.596 --> 00:48:55.635
Hey, who doesn't like money?

00:48:55.636 --> 00:48:57.096
I wouldn't call him greedy.

00:48:58.065 --> 00:48:59.936
He had his reason.

00:49:00.235 --> 00:49:01.235
What was his reason?

00:49:01.335 --> 00:49:03.375
I want to buy Yi Chan a guitar.

00:49:03.605 --> 00:49:04.645
What?

00:49:05.846 --> 00:49:07.745
I already gave him a guitar.

00:49:07.746 --> 00:49:10.944
Oh, that. It soaked up moisture, so it doesn't sound so good.

00:49:10.945 --> 00:49:14.314
Hey, it's good enough for a mediocre guitarist like him.

00:49:14.315 --> 00:49:17.254
Come on, Bal San. A band has to look cool.

00:49:17.255 --> 00:49:18.886
We may be broke, but we're cool.

00:49:18.985 --> 00:49:21.326
Yi Chan is so lucky.

00:49:21.726 --> 00:49:24.525
You're like his lucky charm that suddenly landed in his lap.

00:49:24.726 --> 00:49:25.726
You're tutoring him.

00:49:26.125 --> 00:49:27.235
You started the band for him...

00:49:27.496 --> 00:49:28.636
and want to buy him a guitar.

00:49:28.735 --> 00:49:31.005
Why are you so good to him?

00:49:31.306 --> 00:49:32.436
Tell me. I want to know.

00:49:33.036 --> 00:49:34.406
He said he wanted to twinkle.

00:49:34.936 --> 00:49:36.005
What?

00:49:36.936 --> 00:49:38.875
He said this could be the last chapter of his youth.

00:49:39.645 --> 00:49:41.215
He'll start making money upon graduation.

00:49:41.945 --> 00:49:44.315
So before that, he wants to do everything he's ever wanted to do,

00:49:44.645 --> 00:49:45.686
which is why...

00:49:50.215 --> 00:49:51.855
I want him to shine.

00:49:54.456 --> 00:49:55.795
First, on stage.

00:49:57.496 --> 00:50:00.195
I nearly burst into tears because I was so touched by his words.

00:50:01.436 --> 00:50:03.136
Hey, be good to him.

00:50:03.536 --> 00:50:04.706
He's a nice guy.

00:50:05.835 --> 00:50:07.036
On top of being multi-talented,

00:50:07.875 --> 00:50:09.605
he's such a nice, caring person.

00:50:09.976 --> 00:50:11.445
Even if he gets home very late, let me know.

00:50:14.445 --> 00:50:16.375
Oh, boy.

00:50:23.815 --> 00:50:25.326
(Snail Guesthouse)

00:51:10.395 --> 00:51:11.806
I want him to shine.

00:51:12.906 --> 00:51:14.605
First, on stage.

00:51:15.735 --> 00:51:17.235
Then in life.

00:51:24.145 --> 00:51:26.346
(Baekwang High School)

00:51:26.815 --> 00:51:29.255
First, I want the five-drum set and a large drum right here.

00:51:29.715 --> 00:51:31.926
I want Se Gyeong to experience a magnificent performance.

00:51:32.056 --> 00:51:33.155
What are you selling?

00:51:33.156 --> 00:51:34.525
Don't you need a snake and a pipe too?

00:51:34.726 --> 00:51:36.955
Percussion instruments are the only kind of musical instrument...

00:51:36.956 --> 00:51:38.766
that can prove that the heart isn't a vestigial organ.

00:51:39.096 --> 00:51:40.125
Forget it.

00:51:40.426 --> 00:51:42.765
We need two pianos. Here and this spot here.

00:51:42.766 --> 00:51:44.835
And we'll use a synth, so pay attention to the sound quality.

00:51:45.136 --> 00:51:47.405
Who is Cindy? Why is she performing with us?

00:51:47.406 --> 00:51:50.005
A synthesizer, you idiot!

00:51:50.235 --> 00:51:51.774
It's a musical instrument, not a person.

00:51:51.775 --> 00:51:53.575
It's very expensive.

00:51:53.576 --> 00:51:55.245
Gosh, you know nothing about music.

00:51:55.246 --> 00:51:57.075
Hyun Yul, is there anything you need to prepare?

00:51:57.076 --> 00:51:58.346
What? No, I'm good.

00:51:59.045 --> 00:52:01.215
I don't need to impress Se Gyeong.

00:52:01.456 --> 00:52:02.886
I'll just flaunt my skills.

00:52:04.326 --> 00:52:07.655
Hyun Yul, you're my last hope.

00:52:07.656 --> 00:52:10.865
Oh, I have a small wish though.

00:52:10.866 --> 00:52:11.866
Okay, what is it?

00:52:11.867 --> 00:52:13.425
A solo part with a pin spotlight...

00:52:13.426 --> 00:52:15.735
shining down on me and no one else.

00:52:15.965 --> 00:52:18.105
That's it. It's about eight minutes long.

00:52:18.436 --> 00:52:20.675
- So you want to impress her too! - So you want to impress her too!

00:52:20.676 --> 00:52:21.734
Calm down.

00:52:21.735 --> 00:52:22.875
What are you guys doing?

00:52:24.246 --> 00:52:25.246
Hey, you're here.

00:52:26.605 --> 00:52:28.676
How come you came alone? Where is Eun Gyeol?

00:52:29.076 --> 00:52:31.116
Eun Gyeol has gone AWOL.

00:52:32.286 --> 00:52:33.915
I can't reach him. He's gone.

00:52:34.255 --> 00:52:35.315
- What? - What?

00:52:35.585 --> 00:52:37.085
Eun Gyeol has gone AWOL?

00:52:37.186 --> 00:52:38.755
And you haven't heard from him at all?

00:52:39.485 --> 00:52:41.255
Does it mean we can't practice today?

00:52:41.525 --> 00:52:42.894
That's not important now.

00:52:42.895 --> 00:52:45.194
It means we don't even know when and if he'll come back.

00:52:45.195 --> 00:52:46.496
He'll come back soon.

00:52:47.065 --> 00:52:49.035
Let's practice without him and wait...

00:52:49.036 --> 00:52:50.164
Until when?

00:52:50.165 --> 00:52:51.805
Until our hair turns Gray?

00:52:51.806 --> 00:52:54.305
Hey, what if he never comes back? What if he's gone for good?

00:52:54.306 --> 00:52:57.235
Darn it. Are you saying we should give up on the performance?

00:52:58.406 --> 00:52:59.706
Darn.

00:53:03.076 --> 00:53:04.786
Se Gyeong might come.

00:53:08.956 --> 00:53:11.386
I wanted to impress Se Gyeong.

00:53:14.556 --> 00:53:15.556
Let's swap him out.

00:53:16.795 --> 00:53:18.665
- What do you mean? - Let's get a new guitarist.

00:53:20.226 --> 00:53:21.294
What?

00:53:21.295 --> 00:53:23.235
I'll bring the guitarist from my choir.

00:53:23.835 --> 00:53:25.906
If he starts practicing with us today, he'll catch up in no time.

00:53:26.505 --> 00:53:28.035
Yes, let's do that.

00:53:28.036 --> 00:53:29.334
That's a very realistic solution.

00:53:29.335 --> 00:53:31.045
- Hey! - You scared me.

00:53:32.846 --> 00:53:34.846
You guys are so mean.

00:53:35.375 --> 00:53:37.915
Hey, how could you be so heartless?

00:53:38.415 --> 00:53:40.915
We pledged to stay together, but our co-member has disappeared.

00:53:41.355 --> 00:53:42.685
How could you say you'd replace him...

00:53:42.686 --> 00:53:44.355
instead of worrying about him first?

00:53:45.286 --> 00:53:46.855
Is the band a joke to you guys?

00:53:47.656 --> 00:53:50.095
Is it just bait to hook up with girls...

00:53:50.096 --> 00:53:51.565
Is the band a joke to you?

00:53:52.065 --> 00:53:53.596
Is it just bait to hook up with a girl?

00:53:55.565 --> 00:53:57.505
Do you think you have the right to say that to us?

00:53:58.565 --> 00:54:00.564
After all, you were the one who kicked out Eun Gyeol!

00:54:00.565 --> 00:54:01.935
And you completely ignored him...

00:54:01.936 --> 00:54:03.505
to impress Se Gyeong.

00:54:05.406 --> 00:54:06.576
Hey, front man.

00:54:07.375 --> 00:54:09.676
So what do you want to do?

00:54:11.085 --> 00:54:12.116
What?

00:54:12.485 --> 00:54:14.255
What's your solution?

00:54:14.855 --> 00:54:16.056
Do you even have an alternative?

00:54:16.255 --> 00:54:18.186
Have you ever come up with a plan for anything?

00:54:19.326 --> 00:54:20.995
If you're our front man,

00:54:20.996 --> 00:54:23.495
pick a direction and start paddling already.

00:54:23.496 --> 00:54:25.596
We're all about to drown because of you!

00:54:27.766 --> 00:54:28.965
We do need to decide.

00:54:29.866 --> 00:54:30.866
What should we do?

00:54:31.206 --> 00:54:32.705
Shall we find a new member or...

00:54:32.706 --> 00:54:33.706
Shut it.

00:54:34.436 --> 00:54:36.636
Only Ha Eun Gyeol can be the main guitarist of our band.

00:54:37.806 --> 00:54:39.346
I will find him no matter what.

00:54:40.005 --> 00:54:41.644
I will find Eun Gyeol at all costs...

00:54:41.645 --> 00:54:43.644
and bring him back!

00:54:43.645 --> 00:54:45.116
You traitors.

00:54:51.625 --> 00:54:53.755

00:55:02.766 --> 00:55:03.795

(Who is the bandsman Mom loved?)

00:55:33.025 --> 00:55:35.334
Hold on. Come to think of it,

00:55:35.335 --> 00:55:37.835
it was because of him that I started pretending...

00:55:38.165 --> 00:55:39.706
that I was Mom.

00:55:40.105 --> 00:55:41.105
Choi Se Gyeong?

00:55:44.346 --> 00:55:46.246
- You are Choi Se Gyeong. - No, I'm not.

00:55:48.576 --> 00:55:49.645
My gosh.

00:55:51.116 --> 00:55:52.985
It is you. Don't you know who I am?

00:55:53.085 --> 00:55:56.556
Had he not called me by that name that day,

00:55:57.085 --> 00:55:59.326
I wouldn't have fallen for...

00:55:59.985 --> 00:56:01.425
No, that came out wrong.

00:56:01.426 --> 00:56:04.925
Anyway, I wouldn't even have thought to look for Mom's first love.

00:56:04.926 --> 00:56:05.964
Also...

00:56:05.965 --> 00:56:07.124
You moved to the US without saying goodbye.

00:56:07.125 --> 00:56:08.334
You're not supposed to come back,

00:56:08.335 --> 00:56:09.995
but you came back, and you're here now.

00:56:09.996 --> 00:56:11.965
What is going on?

00:56:12.806 --> 00:56:16.504
I got a sense that he knew a lot about Mom.

00:56:16.505 --> 00:56:20.005
Something told me that they probably had a very special relationship.

00:56:20.945 --> 00:56:22.045
There's only one way.

00:56:22.315 --> 00:56:24.985
I must find Ha Eun Gyeol and check it myself.

00:56:27.045 --> 00:56:29.286
Please leave a message after the tone.

00:56:30.286 --> 00:56:32.255
Hi, Yi Chan! What are you up to?

00:56:32.525 --> 00:56:34.456
Can we meet at that café at around 7pm?

00:56:34.695 --> 00:56:36.155
I'll wait to hear from you.

00:56:36.156 --> 00:56:37.926
Page me as soon as you get this message.

00:56:40.226 --> 00:56:41.234
Okay.

Please have a look at this. Thank you.

Please take this. Thank you.

00:56:57.846 --> 00:56:59.145
That rude punk.

00:56:59.815 --> 00:57:00.815
Gosh.

00:57:07.085 --> 00:57:08.125

00:57:20.335 --> 00:57:22.206
Hello, did you just page me at 0130?

00:57:22.976 --> 00:57:24.845
I saw the poster.

00:57:24.846 --> 00:57:26.076
You're looking for Ha Eun Gyeol, right?

00:57:26.906 --> 00:57:28.016
Yes, that's right.

00:57:28.415 --> 00:57:29.616
Do you know where he is now?

00:57:30.045 --> 00:57:32.715
Gosh, he'll flip out if he finds out that I told you.

00:57:33.585 --> 00:57:35.714
There is a reward though, right?

00:57:35.715 --> 00:57:37.286
Yes, for sure.

00:57:37.415 --> 00:57:39.556
Where can I meet you?

Hey! Watch where you're going!

00:58:45.996 --> 00:58:47.025
Hi.

00:58:48.665 --> 00:58:49.795
Nice to meet you.

00:59:00.306 --> 00:59:01.346
Where is Eun Gyeol?

00:59:02.476 --> 00:59:03.605
Where is he now?

00:59:04.815 --> 00:59:06.915
How would I know?

00:59:10.386 --> 00:59:12.886
Are you naive or dumb?

00:59:13.215 --> 00:59:14.726
You're just after money, aren't you?

00:59:14.886 --> 00:59:17.156
Bingo.

00:59:18.326 --> 00:59:20.925
Now that it's all out in the open,

00:59:20.926 --> 00:59:22.266
let's get down to business, okay?

00:59:22.465 --> 00:59:24.334
Hand over all the money you have,

00:59:24.335 --> 00:59:25.996
and we'll let you go in one piece.

00:59:26.335 --> 00:59:27.335
I don't have any money.

00:59:28.005 --> 00:59:29.206
Even if I did, I wouldn't give you a penny.

00:59:29.906 --> 00:59:32.635
This is the problem with high school kids in this country.

00:59:32.636 --> 00:59:34.946
When you're nice to them, they just assume that you're actually nice.

00:59:38.275 --> 00:59:41.346
Oh, you're glaring at me.

00:59:43.215 --> 00:59:45.915
Guys, what are you waiting for? We don't have time.

00:59:51.355 --> 00:59:53.096
- Come on. - Get up.

01:00:06.636 --> 01:00:08.746
Oh, no. I'm sorry. Are you all right?

01:00:12.246 --> 01:00:14.044
Wait, hold on.

01:00:14.045 --> 01:00:15.545
You can't leave like that!

01:00:18.215 --> 01:00:19.215
Shoot.

01:00:27.926 --> 01:00:30.935
(Ha Yi Chan)

01:00:33.335 --> 01:00:35.266
Yi Chan. Ha Yi Chan.

01:00:35.706 --> 01:00:37.636
Are you all right? Hey, open your eyes.

01:01:42.835 --> 01:01:43.866
Let's do it together.

01:01:44.906 --> 01:01:45.976
The band.

01:01:46.005 --> 01:01:48.076
I will give you the best band as a present.

01:01:48.206 --> 01:01:50.746
I will make your youth twinkle just like your wish.

01:01:52.476 --> 01:01:54.415
Do what I say just this once. Please?

01:01:54.585 --> 01:01:56.045
You just need to be careful this year. Okay?

01:01:58.215 --> 01:02:00.485
I'll keep you safe no matter what.

01:02:00.585 --> 01:02:01.726
Just for a year.

01:02:02.656 --> 01:02:04.525
Just for one year, not your whole life.

01:02:05.125 --> 01:02:07.525
Can't you even stay by my side just for one year?

01:02:30.616 --> 01:02:31.656
Good job.

01:02:33.255 --> 01:02:35.025
I got it. I'll help you then.

01:02:35.185 --> 01:02:36.555
I'll do a band with you.

01:02:36.556 --> 01:02:38.696
I'll teach you how to play guitar. I'll do everything for you.

01:02:41.065 --> 01:02:42.565
Today is our first day together.

01:02:48.866 --> 01:02:50.306
You said you'd keep me safe.

01:02:54.335 --> 01:02:55.706
You said you'd help me get into college...

01:02:57.576 --> 01:02:58.915
and that we should start a band together.

01:03:03.985 --> 01:03:06.355
Ha Eun Gyeol! Where are you, seriously?

01:03:22.266 --> 01:03:26.176

(Karaoke Music Video Room)

01:03:56.206 --> 01:03:58.175
- Excuse me. - Yes?

01:03:58.176 --> 01:04:00.076
What year is this?

01:04:01.076 --> 01:04:03.175
It's 2023. Why?

01:04:03.176 --> 01:04:04.545
Did you say 2023?

01:04:05.576 --> 01:04:07.045
Not 1995?

01:04:07.886 --> 01:04:10.084
- What are you talking about? - Wait.

01:04:10.085 --> 01:04:13.556
Isn't La Vida Music around here? A musical instrument shop.

01:04:14.755 --> 01:04:16.025
No, not that I know of.

01:04:25.596 --> 01:04:26.636
So...

01:04:28.065 --> 01:04:29.335
I've returned to the present?

01:04:57.726 --> 01:05:00.496

01:05:32.536 --> 01:05:35.234
Yi Chan didn't come home last night.

01:05:35.235 --> 01:05:37.905
I had a bad dream.

01:05:37.906 --> 01:05:39.475
What about Mom? Where's Mom?

01:05:39.476 --> 01:05:40.774
If you go back now,

01:05:40.775 --> 01:05:43.175
your 2023 will look very different...

01:05:43.176 --> 01:05:45.115
from the 2023 you came from.

01:05:45.116 --> 01:05:46.576
Do you still wish to go back?

01:05:46.875 --> 01:05:47.915
"Yoon Chung Ah?"

01:05:48.085 --> 01:05:49.714
Mom!

01:05:49.715 --> 01:05:51.254
You're not allowed to use sign language in this house.

01:05:51.255 --> 01:05:53.016
What are you doing now?

01:05:53.185 --> 01:05:55.625
I want to help your daughter find the world she lost.

01:05:55.726 --> 01:05:56.925
I want to build her a bridge.

01:05:56.926 --> 01:05:59.556
Yi Chan, it's me. I can't reach you.

01:05:59.826 --> 01:06:01.766
I found Ha Eun Gyeol.
