(Twinkling Watermelon)

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:58.779
Dazzling lights come on,

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:00.648
and people call my name.

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:02.849
Se Gyeong, can you try acting surprised?

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:03.919
(Episode 4)

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:04.989
- That's great. - She's so pretty.

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:07.119
- Now, stand there looking pretty. - Look at her face. How adorable.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.789
- She looks like a doll. - My, you look adorable.

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:11.489
- She has such a pretty smile. - Cut. Okay.

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.060
- She's so cute. - We'll take a quick break.

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:14.929
We'll take a ten-minute break.

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.059
- We'll take a ten-minute break. - We'll take a ten-minute break.

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.129
I thought my life was always meant to shine,

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:20.130
just like that.

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:22.869
You're doing such an amazing job.

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:24.339
Everyone says you're so adorable.

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.009
Did you get ice cream on your lips?

00:01:26.709 --> 00:01:28.479
- Always be confident and... - My gosh, ma'am.

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:30.339
Se Gyeong is so pretty.

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:31.749
She looks like a doll.

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.850
Thank you. Please take good care of my daughter.

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:37.148
Se Gyeong, you did a great job. Let's take a quick break.

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:38.190
Okay.

00:01:40.089 --> 00:01:41.589
- Director. - Yes.

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.619
Don't you think she looks like that actress?

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:44.889
Who?

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:47.129
You know, that rookie actress that burst onto the scene...

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.660
and rose to stardom before she suddenly disappeared.

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:51.800
Was her name Shin A Young?

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:54.770
Shin A Young?

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.440
The moment I heard that name, everything changed.

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.909
Who wants to go next?

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:06.780
- Me! - Get ready.

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:08.550
- Let's go! - Come this way!

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.479
- Can I take this? - Of course.

00:02:12.149 --> 00:02:13.189
Se Gyeong!

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.258
- Happy birthday! - Happy birthday!

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:17.559
Let's keep up the fun...

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.489
and start the scavenger hunt now.

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.829
Who thinks this scavenger hunt will be fun?

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:23.830
Raise your hand.

00:02:23.831 --> 00:02:24.868
- Me! - Me!

00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:26.500
Applause, everyone. Let's get started!

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.638
- Yes! - Let's start the scavenger hunt.

00:02:29.639 --> 00:02:32.439
Which way shall we go? Where could it be?

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:33.940
My gosh. Where are the treasures hidden?

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.579
Oh, dear.

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:31.228
Oh, my. That young girl has got quite the talent.

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:32.828
I heard her parents worked in showbiz.

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:34.069
The rumours must be true.

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:39.469
No way.

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:40.809
She was treated at a fertility clinic in the US...

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.310
and still struggled to conceive her.

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.319
She can never replace our dear daughter, Han Na.

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:33.760
She is... I mean,

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:36.960
she's nothing like Han Na.

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:41.470
Stop drinking and take your medicine.

00:04:42.499 --> 00:04:43.939
Drinking alcohol won't help you in any way.

00:04:45.939 --> 00:04:47.340
Medicine won't help me either.

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:50.640
It's not like taking this will make Han Na come back alive.

00:04:51.749 --> 00:04:52.850
What, then?

00:04:53.809 --> 00:04:55.650
Are you saying we should dissolve the adoption?

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:58.289
Why not?

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:01.960
We couldn't even protect our real daughter.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:05.890
At that moment, the lights suddenly went out,

00:05:07.059 --> 00:05:08.830
and I could finally take a good look at myself.

00:05:09.359 --> 00:05:10.400
I was...

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:21.479
nothing but a living doll a sweet husband got as a gift...

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:23.939
for his wife who was depressed after losing her young daughter.

00:05:36.559 --> 00:05:37.859
I'll see you later, sweetie.

00:05:57.749 --> 00:05:58.850
Mom.

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:05.720
Mom, I want to learn the cello.

00:06:22.499 --> 00:06:23.970
I wanted to shine again.

00:06:46.859 --> 00:06:48.960
(The 25th Jinsung Classical Music Competition)

00:07:21.229 --> 00:07:22.629
- Brava! - Brava!

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:29.999
Brava!

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:31.809
Brava!

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:33.309
Just like that, the lights came back on,

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:36.510
and my life started to shine again.

00:07:38.479 --> 00:07:41.119
Gosh, why is he taking so long?

00:07:59.799 --> 00:08:00.830
Pretty, right?

00:08:02.739 --> 00:08:03.770
That's me.

00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:05.869
In 11th grade, I think.

00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:09.080
I believe it was taken shortly before I moved to the US.

00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:11.080
I see.

00:08:16.549 --> 00:08:17.549
Ma'am.

00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:21.188
I mean, that was what I had thought.

00:08:21.189 --> 00:08:22.220
Did you just call me "Ma'am?"

00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:24.119
My gosh. It really is you.

00:08:24.929 --> 00:08:26.858
Until I met this fool.

00:08:26.859 --> 00:08:29.629
I had no idea I'd run into you here, ma'am.

00:08:32.669 --> 00:08:35.340
Oh, my. You really studied cello.

00:08:35.539 --> 00:08:36.869
It totally suits you.

00:08:38.609 --> 00:08:40.710
You sure know how to respect your elders.

00:08:40.979 --> 00:08:42.479
What a polite young boy.

00:08:43.410 --> 00:08:45.748
I can talk casually to you, right?

00:08:45.749 --> 00:08:47.919
Yes, of course. You're way older than me...

00:08:50.019 --> 00:08:51.089
I'm sorry.

00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:53.489
You look so much like this lady I know.

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:54.759
This is refreshing.

00:08:55.119 --> 00:08:56.559
Normally, guys say I remind them...

00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:58.359
of their late mothers or ex-girlfriends.

00:08:58.790 --> 00:09:01.759
Oh. If you're thinking it worked, you're wrong.

00:09:02.499 --> 00:09:03.629
Wait.

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:05.800
I'm sorry if I offended you.

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:09.339
But that lady I know is very beautiful...

00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:10.669
on top of being incredibly intelligent.

00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:12.638
So I should be grateful? Or are you trying to comfort me?

00:09:12.639 --> 00:09:13.710
Neither.

00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:16.309
I'm just saying she's beautiful even though she's older.

00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:18.209
Are you engaged in a forbidden relationship of some sort?

00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:19.580
Gosh, no. Not at all.

00:09:19.979 --> 00:09:21.820
I'm just hugely indebted to her.

00:09:22.019 --> 00:09:24.850
It was thanks to her help that I could join a band when I was lost.

00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:26.649
A band? Again?

00:09:27.149 --> 00:09:29.320
Men are so predictable.

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:31.258
- Sorry? - Why do men assume...

00:09:31.259 --> 00:09:33.560
that every girl would like guys in bands?

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:35.228
I'm performing today.

00:09:35.229 --> 00:09:36.700
If you're free, you should come.

00:09:39.769 --> 00:09:40.869
(April 15, 2023, 8pm, Club Spark)

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:43.200
You're in a band.

00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:46.440
So was my first love.

00:09:46.509 --> 00:09:47.639
Really?

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:50.408
Why do men assume...

00:09:50.409 --> 00:09:52.850
that every girl would like guys in bands?

00:09:54.649 --> 00:09:56.320
Ma'am, it really is you.

00:09:56.879 --> 00:09:58.748
Why didn't you come to my performance that day?

00:09:58.749 --> 00:10:00.590
You said you'd bring your daughter.

00:10:01.019 --> 00:10:02.289
- I have a daughter? - Yes.

00:10:02.290 --> 00:10:03.459
You said she was also studying cello...

00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:04.460
Hey!

00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:10.430
I'm going to take my hand off now.

00:10:11.029 --> 00:10:12.499
Please don't scream.

00:10:13.129 --> 00:10:14.129
One,

00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:16.440
two, three.

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:19.840
Thank you.

00:10:20.409 --> 00:10:23.540
Thank you.

00:10:29.149 --> 00:10:30.450
He's so persistent.

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:32.249
I did well, though.

00:10:41.729 --> 00:10:43.899
Yes, that's right.

00:10:44.769 --> 00:10:46.670
I'm the guy who confessed his feelings to Choi Se Gyeong.

00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:51.769
Gosh, this is embarrassing.

00:10:54.879 --> 00:10:55.979
I was immature...

00:10:57.810 --> 00:10:58.950
for thinking...

00:11:00.249 --> 00:11:02.019
I should start a band because I was so in love.

00:11:04.149 --> 00:11:05.190
Oh, sorry.

00:11:07.119 --> 00:11:08.460
I should introduce myself.

00:11:08.519 --> 00:11:10.759
I'm Ha Yi Chan.

00:11:11.389 --> 00:11:13.590
Watch out. You might end up falling for my charms.

00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:25.269
Well... Would you please say something?

00:11:25.409 --> 00:11:26.509
This is embarrassing.

00:11:27.979 --> 00:11:29.609
Can you at least smile? I'm embarrassed.

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:32.279
Am I talking to myself?

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:38.090
Hey, why are you staring at my lips like that?

00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:40.450
Do I have something on my lips?

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:46.330
I bet you're staring at me because I'm so handsome!

00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:55.639
You're really quiet.

00:11:56.570 --> 00:11:57.909
Anyway, thanks for everything today...

00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:02.509
Blood. You're bleeding!

00:12:04.139 --> 00:12:05.979
Hey, you're bleeding. Right here!

00:12:12.489 --> 00:12:14.619
My gosh. You're so tough.

00:12:18.590 --> 00:12:20.159
Wait, hold on.

00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:41.180
Where is he? That little...

00:12:44.550 --> 00:12:46.549
Hey, girls!

00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:47.850
We've got a problem!

00:12:48.389 --> 00:12:50.858
The PE teacher is at the supply room now.

00:12:50.859 --> 00:12:52.728
He's going bonkers, looking for the key.

00:12:52.729 --> 00:12:54.430
Hey, what should we do?

00:12:55.729 --> 00:12:56.799
- Hurry. - Let's go.

00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:58.070
What should we do?

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:01.969
Darn it, you brat.

00:13:01.970 --> 00:13:03.169
You little rat.

00:13:03.170 --> 00:13:05.170
Where did you pick up such bad habits?

00:13:05.909 --> 00:13:07.040
Open the door, you punk!

00:13:07.609 --> 00:13:08.709
No one's here.

00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:12.209
Darn you. Are you trying to mess with me?

00:13:12.210 --> 00:13:13.609
How dare you!

00:13:14.149 --> 00:13:15.819
- Darn it. - Please calm down.

00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:16.850
"Calm down?"

00:13:19.489 --> 00:13:21.859
- Gosh, you little... - Hey.

00:13:22.019 --> 00:13:24.889
Seriously, what's your deal? Why are you just sitting there?

00:13:25.129 --> 00:13:26.659
Hey, this concerns you too.

00:13:26.889 --> 00:13:28.228
If we're caught together,

00:13:28.229 --> 00:13:29.430
things will get complicated for you too.

00:13:29.499 --> 00:13:31.129
And because of the way you look,

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:33.670
I'll get into trouble.

00:13:33.930 --> 00:13:36.670
Hey, please help me just this once.

00:13:36.739 --> 00:13:38.408
Sir, let's talk.

00:13:38.409 --> 00:13:39.768
There's been some misunderstanding.

00:13:39.769 --> 00:13:41.310
- Open the door, you punk! - Please calm down.

00:13:42.479 --> 00:13:43.509
That hurt.

00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:48.019
Anyway, they went to get the key. What's taking them so long?

00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:51.118
- Sir. - Sir, let us explain.

00:13:51.119 --> 00:13:52.219
Explain what?

00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:54.219
We didn't lock the door on purpose.

00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:55.618
- Sir! - It really wasn't intentional.

00:13:55.619 --> 00:13:57.359
- My gosh. - There you are.

00:13:57.720 --> 00:13:59.790
Did you have to get a new key made or something?

00:14:00.029 --> 00:14:01.899
- You little... - I'm sorry, sir.

00:14:10.070 --> 00:14:11.710
(Yong Jun Ki)

00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:26.379
Gosh, why isn't the car here yet?

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:31.819
I'm sorry. Can I ask you one last question?

00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:33.950
Sorry, this old lady is busy today.

00:15:34.050 --> 00:15:36.420
Please, just one more question.

00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:38.060
Is Mr. Viva...

00:15:38.489 --> 00:15:40.059
I mean, how's your father?

00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:41.060
Why?

00:15:41.229 --> 00:15:43.158
Don't you also want to know how many spoons my family has?

00:15:43.159 --> 00:15:44.970
No, I don't care about your spoons. Tell me about your father.

00:15:45.269 --> 00:15:48.499
The truth is, your father taught me.

00:15:51.070 --> 00:15:52.638
My father taught you?

00:15:52.639 --> 00:15:53.670
Yes.

00:15:53.909 --> 00:15:57.080
He's like my mentor. I'm hugely indebted to him.

00:15:57.609 --> 00:15:59.350
He was so kind to me.

00:16:00.149 --> 00:16:02.779
I'd really like to meet him. How can I meet him?

00:16:03.149 --> 00:16:04.989
Well, I'm sorry,

00:16:05.050 --> 00:16:07.248
but you don't look like you're in college yet.

00:16:07.249 --> 00:16:09.220
What exactly did my father teach you?

00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:11.290
Guitar.

00:16:11.830 --> 00:16:14.858
Out of all the guitarists I know,

00:16:14.859 --> 00:16:16.300
your father was the best one.

00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:23.840
You.

00:16:25.810 --> 00:16:26.940
Who are you, really?

00:16:36.279 --> 00:16:38.989
I'm telling you. My grandma rocks.

00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:44.259
She always said you could build a bridge by pushing a wall down.

00:16:44.859 --> 00:16:46.830
Who knew we'd find a way out of there?

00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:54.369
So you weren't hiding? Were you locked in there?

00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:57.840
I knew it.

00:16:58.310 --> 00:17:01.580
I was wondering why the steel door was barricaded with a mop.

00:17:02.739 --> 00:17:04.180
I know I'm being nosy,

00:17:04.379 --> 00:17:06.210
but you should tell someone and get help.

00:17:06.580 --> 00:17:07.909
If you keep it to yourself, no one will know.

00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:12.749
No, you can't handle this by yourself.

00:17:13.820 --> 00:17:15.590
If you have no one... Since we met like this today,

00:17:16.519 --> 00:17:17.720
I'll help you.

00:17:18.430 --> 00:17:20.159
There are some athletes staying at my grandma's guesthouse,

00:17:20.889 --> 00:17:22.359
so I've been working out too.

00:17:28.030 --> 00:17:30.070
You don't need to thank me. It's all good.

00:17:32.469 --> 00:17:35.810
Oh, right. We met like this, so I should at least know your name.

00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:49.060
I told you. I've been working out.

00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:55.000
If you need my help, let me know.

00:17:56.199 --> 00:17:57.830
I'll come to your rescue with my athlete friends.

00:17:59.330 --> 00:18:01.570
Well, I'll be off then.

00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:17.480
(Contact us to join the band, First Love Memory Manipulators.)

00:18:21.859 --> 00:18:22.959
Tell me.

00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:25.329
No lies. Only tell me the truth.

00:18:25.330 --> 00:18:27.560
Well, I'm not lying.

00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:29.829
Like I said earlier,

00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:31.158
your father ran a musical instrument shop...

00:18:31.159 --> 00:18:33.198
in the neighbourhood where I grew up.

00:18:33.199 --> 00:18:34.669
- That's where I learned... - You're lying.

00:18:35.199 --> 00:18:36.539
My father is a physics professor.

00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:38.000
He never ran a store.

00:18:38.639 --> 00:18:39.909
That can't be.

00:18:40.609 --> 00:18:42.139
I swear, I was told you were his daughter.

00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:46.280
That person told you that I was his daughter?

00:18:48.109 --> 00:18:49.178
No.

00:18:49.179 --> 00:18:51.418
If you don't mind me asking,

00:18:51.419 --> 00:18:54.590
how did you know Mr. Viva?

00:18:55.090 --> 00:18:56.118
I'm his daughter.

00:18:56.119 --> 00:18:58.760
I said that? I was the one who told you that?

00:19:00.129 --> 00:19:01.458
You really aren't in your right mind.

00:19:01.459 --> 00:19:03.760
I understand that you find it hard to believe.

00:19:04.199 --> 00:19:05.868
You see, I have a bit of a situation,

00:19:05.869 --> 00:19:07.869
- so I can't tell you right now. - Tell me now.

00:19:08.369 --> 00:19:09.699
What is that "situation?"

00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:11.570
That's...

00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:17.540
I'd say it's like straight out of a sci-Fi movie or...

00:19:19.209 --> 00:19:20.708
Gosh, this is nuts. How should I explain this?

00:19:20.709 --> 00:19:21.780
Did he send you?

00:19:22.250 --> 00:19:24.148
Did he ask you to see how I'd react?

00:19:24.149 --> 00:19:25.718
To mess with me if I seemed calm and comfortable?

00:19:25.719 --> 00:19:27.688
- Wait, I just... - To provoke me if I seemed happy?

00:19:27.689 --> 00:19:29.289
To ruin everything for me if I seemed to be doing well?

00:19:29.290 --> 00:19:31.730
Why on earth are you doing this to me?

00:19:32.090 --> 00:19:33.129
Se Gyeong.

00:19:40.629 --> 00:19:41.800
What's wrong, Se Gyeong?

00:19:42.199 --> 00:19:43.240
What's going on?

00:19:43.639 --> 00:19:44.669
Se Gyeong?

00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:47.368
(Choi Se Gyeong)

00:19:47.369 --> 00:19:50.179
Hold on. Was she the reason...

00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:51.409
you wanted to start a band?

00:19:51.949 --> 00:19:53.049
Do you guys know each other?

00:19:53.050 --> 00:19:54.080
- Yes. - No.

00:19:55.919 --> 00:19:57.719
Let me warn you both.

00:19:58.750 --> 00:20:00.550
Do not show up in front of me again.

00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:04.760
Se Gyeong, wait.

00:20:04.889 --> 00:20:07.358
- Se Gyeong! - Hold on.

00:20:07.359 --> 00:20:09.560
So she was Dad's first love,

00:20:10.429 --> 00:20:12.530
and Mr. Viva isn't her father?

00:20:13.399 --> 00:20:14.469
What is happening here?

00:20:15.199 --> 00:20:16.240
Hey, you.

00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:18.169
How dare you make Se Gyeong cry?

00:20:19.209 --> 00:20:20.770
Who do you think you are?

00:20:45.270 --> 00:20:46.330
Wait!

00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:50.770
Please stop sending me flowers.

00:20:53.139 --> 00:20:55.109
You abandoned me, so move on already.

00:20:57.379 --> 00:20:58.679
Don't look for me again.

00:21:09.619 --> 00:21:10.689
Are you all right?

00:21:16.859 --> 00:21:18.059
I'm home.

00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:19.500
Hi, daughter. You're home.

00:21:19.899 --> 00:21:21.329
You must be tired.

00:21:21.330 --> 00:21:23.638
Aren't you on the phone with someone?

00:21:23.639 --> 00:21:25.639
Good timing. I just got off the phone.

00:21:25.909 --> 00:21:27.540
Wait. Should I say, "Bad timing?"

00:21:27.740 --> 00:21:28.909
I was talking to your dad.

00:21:29.639 --> 00:21:31.379
Oh, no. I wish I had walked in a few minutes earlier.

00:21:32.350 --> 00:21:34.079
Wash up and come downstairs. Let's have some tea.

00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:35.149
I have something to tell you.

00:21:36.619 --> 00:21:38.820
The US? It's sudden.

00:21:38.990 --> 00:21:41.789
I know. The university where your dad's teaching now...

00:21:41.790 --> 00:21:43.718
wants him to stay for good.

00:21:43.719 --> 00:21:45.530
They'll find him a lab where he can continue his research.

00:21:46.330 --> 00:21:48.858
He thinks it'd be good for the family to live together.

00:21:48.859 --> 00:21:50.159
Then what about my school?

00:21:50.199 --> 00:21:52.429
Wasn't it my goal to get into Juilliard next year?

00:21:52.830 --> 00:21:53.830
Right.

00:21:53.831 --> 00:21:55.898
But it wouldn't be a bad idea to move there now...

00:21:55.899 --> 00:21:57.439
so you can start preparing step by step.

00:21:57.740 --> 00:21:58.968
You can take the language course...

00:21:58.969 --> 00:22:00.540
and the master classes too.

00:22:00.969 --> 00:22:03.209
That's what I think. How do you feel?

00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:06.080
- It'll be nice. - You don't need to think about it?

00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:10.249
No, I'll be happy to do that.

00:22:10.250 --> 00:22:12.350
I don't really want to stay in Korea anyway.

00:22:13.490 --> 00:22:16.189
Why not? Why don't you want to stay in Korea?

00:22:17.859 --> 00:22:18.929
Did something happen?

00:22:19.659 --> 00:22:21.459
No, nothing happened.

00:22:21.929 --> 00:22:25.060
Whatever makes you happy makes me happy too.

00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:27.369
Thank you.

00:22:29.070 --> 00:22:30.570
You're always on my side.

00:22:31.869 --> 00:22:34.168
Se Gyeong, can you go out and see?

00:22:34.169 --> 00:22:35.209
Someone's here to see you.

00:22:35.639 --> 00:22:37.639
- Someone's here for me? - Yes.

00:22:46.850 --> 00:22:48.790
Wait, Se Gyeong. Just a moment.

00:22:49.389 --> 00:22:50.389
I have something to say.

00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:54.158
Don't you know what a warning means?

00:22:54.159 --> 00:22:56.030
I do. I'm sorry.

00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:57.958
It's just that it's so hard to see you.

00:22:57.959 --> 00:22:59.429
You should leave before I call for help.

00:23:01.330 --> 00:23:02.699
I'll do it, no matter what you say.

00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:10.439
I'll do whatever it takes to start a band...

00:23:10.810 --> 00:23:12.280
and put on a performance dedicated to you.

00:23:13.909 --> 00:23:14.949
That's right.

00:23:15.050 --> 00:23:17.619
I know it kind of started as a joke,

00:23:18.790 --> 00:23:20.050
but I promised you I'd do that.

00:23:21.350 --> 00:23:24.490
I keep my promises, no matter what.

00:23:26.060 --> 00:23:27.730
So keep your promise.

00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:30.359
Just watch me as I pull it off.

00:23:31.969 --> 00:23:33.069
You can't even do that?

00:23:33.070 --> 00:23:35.500
You already have someone watching you.

00:23:42.409 --> 00:23:43.980
Gosh, he followed me all the way here?

00:23:45.409 --> 00:23:47.250
Anyway, I came here to tell you this.

00:23:48.050 --> 00:23:49.649
Sorry for bugging you.

00:23:50.750 --> 00:23:52.350
Until the day I keep my promise,

00:23:54.149 --> 00:23:56.260
I'll do my best not to show up in front of you again.

00:24:19.350 --> 00:24:20.350
Hey.

00:24:21.379 --> 00:24:22.750
Do you like Choi Se Gyeong that much?

00:24:23.649 --> 00:24:25.080
Give up already.

00:24:25.250 --> 00:24:27.448
She'll marry someone else anyway.

00:24:27.449 --> 00:24:28.519
She'll have a beautiful daughter,

00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:30.490
and they'll live happily together in a nice house.

00:24:32.030 --> 00:24:34.189
So forget her before you get hurt.

00:24:34.389 --> 00:24:36.459
I told you. You're meant to be with someone else...

00:24:38.830 --> 00:24:40.169
Are you putting a curse on me?

00:24:40.669 --> 00:24:42.469
Or do you enjoy being grabbed by the collar?

00:24:42.639 --> 00:24:44.138
I'm just telling you the truth.

00:24:44.139 --> 00:24:45.340
"Truth" about what?

00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:47.968
Seriously, why are you doing this to me?

00:24:47.969 --> 00:24:49.438
You conned me into believing that you were Yoon Dong Jin.

00:24:49.439 --> 00:24:51.678
You're trying to get in my way and ruin everything I do.

00:24:51.679 --> 00:24:53.409
Who are you, really?

00:24:54.179 --> 00:24:57.118
I am your son.

00:24:57.119 --> 00:24:58.219
What?

00:24:58.850 --> 00:25:01.520
What is it? What's with those eyes?

00:25:02.419 --> 00:25:03.459
I...

00:25:04.159 --> 00:25:06.590
come from a world you probably can't even imagine.

00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:09.859
Is that so? Are you from the future or something?

00:25:10.129 --> 00:25:12.800
- How did you know? - You crazy idiot.

00:25:13.030 --> 00:25:15.230
I'm a fool for expecting you to say something that makes sense.

00:25:17.169 --> 00:25:19.309
Hey, where are you going? I'm not done talking yet.

00:25:19.310 --> 00:25:20.909
I'm going to the future.

00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:22.080
Don't follow me!

00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:26.080
Don't follow me!

00:25:28.010 --> 00:25:29.580
Darn it. Hey!

00:25:35.020 --> 00:25:36.760
I'm not done talking yet!

00:26:04.219 --> 00:26:05.250
Gosh, that idiot.

(Snail Guesthouse)

00:26:19.270 --> 00:26:21.530
It's really here.

00:26:22.439 --> 00:26:24.770
I had only heard Dad talk about Snail Guesthouse.

00:26:25.810 --> 00:26:26.840
This is amazing.

00:26:36.149 --> 00:26:39.089
I need to talk to you about something. Come here.

00:26:39.090 --> 00:26:41.350
Wait! Why? What is it?

00:26:42.290 --> 00:26:43.419
Great-grandma?

00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:46.060
Why? What is it?

00:26:46.061 --> 00:26:48.159
Leave. Get out of my house at once!

00:26:48.830 --> 00:26:51.600
Come on, Grandma. Let's talk.

00:26:51.929 --> 00:26:53.868
Humans have been using language to communicate for eons.

00:26:53.869 --> 00:26:55.539
Seriously, what's your problem today?

00:26:55.540 --> 00:26:57.600
"What's your problem today?"

00:26:58.300 --> 00:27:00.340
You little brat, I must teach you a lesson.

00:27:14.090 --> 00:27:15.490

(Ranking in Class)

00:27:21.889 --> 00:27:23.060
What? 53rd place?

00:27:23.260 --> 00:27:24.599
Not in the country or the entire school.

00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:27.199
He came in 53rd place out of the 57 students in his class?

00:27:27.570 --> 00:27:29.069
Dad did so poorly in school.

00:27:29.070 --> 00:27:30.539
Here, take this.

00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:32.609
Fold this and play slap-match with it.

00:27:32.969 --> 00:27:35.069
Play all you want. Even if you end up on the streets,

00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:37.009
I don't care anymore.

00:27:37.010 --> 00:27:39.648
Grandma, would you be happy if your grandson ended up on the streets?

00:27:39.649 --> 00:27:42.780
If you come back home in one piece, you'll die at my hands, you punk.

00:27:43.850 --> 00:27:46.050
- Ma'am, please calm down. - You get out too.

00:27:47.020 --> 00:27:48.020
Oh, dear.

00:27:49.090 --> 00:27:52.020
They say you should never be kind to anyone for humans are ungrateful.

00:27:52.129 --> 00:27:54.689
I've wasted my life.

00:27:55.659 --> 00:27:57.358
You said you'd get a tutor,

00:27:57.359 --> 00:28:01.330
so I thought you'd start studying at last!

00:28:02.199 --> 00:28:03.300
Grandma.

00:28:03.570 --> 00:28:06.169
Why are you still here? Take him and get out!

00:28:06.310 --> 00:28:07.840
I have nowhere else to go.

00:28:08.310 --> 00:28:09.310
I'm sorry.

00:28:11.439 --> 00:28:14.010
He's my tutor. Don't be rude, please.

00:28:14.449 --> 00:28:16.449
I told you. He goes to Chuncheon National University of Education.

00:28:19.750 --> 00:28:21.619
Tutor, my foot!

00:28:22.419 --> 00:28:24.358
He's probably some good-for-nothing.

00:28:24.359 --> 00:28:26.129
I'm going to be his tutor.

00:28:27.330 --> 00:28:29.359
I'll do my best to teach him well.

00:28:30.359 --> 00:28:33.198
I'll do my best to follow your teachings.

00:28:33.199 --> 00:28:34.230
Yes, great!

00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:52.290

00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:06.269
Grandma, is this really necessary?

00:29:06.270 --> 00:29:07.428
Sung Dae.

00:29:07.429 --> 00:29:10.368
All right. Solve the ten practice questions.

00:29:10.369 --> 00:29:12.439
You have 25 minutes.

00:29:12.810 --> 00:29:14.510
Okay. Get ready.

00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:16.580
Start.

00:29:46.609 --> 00:29:48.570
- I'm done. - What? Already?

00:29:48.909 --> 00:29:50.439
You still have ten minutes left.

00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:29.820
My gosh, Mr. Tutor.

00:30:30.449 --> 00:30:31.849
Thank you so much.

00:30:31.850 --> 00:30:34.189
- Gosh. - My goodness.

00:30:34.790 --> 00:30:35.859
Yes!

00:30:36.790 --> 00:30:38.060
Mr. Tutor.

00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:41.429
Yi Chan has a lot to learn.

00:30:42.189 --> 00:30:44.959
Please teach him and guide him well.

00:30:45.330 --> 00:30:47.070
Please take good care of him.

00:30:49.199 --> 00:30:51.100
I'll do my best to make him become a decent person.

00:30:51.770 --> 00:30:53.169
What? I'm not even a decent human yet?

00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:02.179
Tonight,

00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:05.719
we'll have a pork belly feast.

00:31:09.159 --> 00:31:13.330
- Pork belly! - Pork belly!

00:31:13.830 --> 00:31:15.260
Here, guys. Cheers.

00:31:16.199 --> 00:31:18.929
- Cheers! - Cheers!

00:31:19.100 --> 00:31:21.629
- Bottoms up! - Cheers!

00:31:28.070 --> 00:31:29.909
Hey, make me a lettuce wrap.

00:31:30.179 --> 00:31:32.480
- Sure, with two pieces of meat... - Nice.

00:31:32.750 --> 00:31:34.178
Why are you staring at me like that?

00:31:34.179 --> 00:31:36.249
I was just admiring your face...

00:31:36.250 --> 00:31:40.389
because you look so smart and handsome.

00:31:40.619 --> 00:31:42.658
- The green onion salad and kimchi. - By the way,

00:31:42.659 --> 00:31:44.520
- Oh, no. I don't want to drop this. - did Bal San go somewhere?

00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:47.060
He'd never miss out on something like this.

00:31:47.159 --> 00:31:50.629
He went on a two-day trip to Yangpyeong with his school friends.

00:31:53.399 --> 00:31:55.199
Speak of the devil.

00:31:56.639 --> 00:32:00.040
Oh, my. This deliciously greasy, meaty aroma must be...

00:32:01.169 --> 00:32:02.510
It's pork belly!

00:32:03.740 --> 00:32:05.638
Hey! You've had enough. Move!

00:32:05.639 --> 00:32:07.449
Bal San, seriously.

00:32:11.179 --> 00:32:14.389
I'll bring more meat. Eat as much as you want.

00:32:14.689 --> 00:32:16.619
- Bring more soju too! - Don't drink too much.

00:32:16.889 --> 00:32:19.128
- Okay! - Okay. Thank you.

00:32:19.129 --> 00:32:20.329
- Here, cheers. - My gosh.

00:32:20.330 --> 00:32:22.859
- Cheers! - Cheers!

00:32:27.629 --> 00:32:28.830
I see a new face.

00:32:29.070 --> 00:32:31.300
Bal San, say hi. This is my tutor.

00:32:31.570 --> 00:32:32.570
He goes to CNUE.

00:32:32.571 --> 00:32:34.239
Second year, Mathematics Education.

00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:36.639
Yoon Dong Jin. He's my tutor.

00:32:36.780 --> 00:32:39.350
Chuncheon National University of Education? Yoon Dong Jin?

00:32:42.179 --> 00:32:43.320
Why do you look so flustered?

00:32:43.619 --> 00:32:46.750
Aren't you going to say hi? He's the guitar genius you taught.

00:32:47.189 --> 00:32:48.449
My gosh.

00:32:50.490 --> 00:32:51.889
Dong Jin, it really is you!

00:32:52.659 --> 00:32:54.990
What did you do? You've gotten so handsome.

00:32:55.359 --> 00:32:58.030
It's me, Bal San. Don't you remember me?

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:04.240
Dong Jin, just stay put for the time being.

00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:08.539
I'll fill you in on the details later.

00:33:08.540 --> 00:33:09.740
I'm sorry,

00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:12.080
but he already knows that I'm not Yoon Dong Jin.

00:33:13.780 --> 00:33:14.780
What?

00:33:16.449 --> 00:33:17.919
No wonder you look nothing like him.

00:33:20.189 --> 00:33:22.889
Hey, come here. Look at me.

00:33:23.060 --> 00:33:24.459
Be honest, okay?

00:33:24.959 --> 00:33:26.530
You don't know Yoon Dong Jin,

00:33:27.159 --> 00:33:28.189
do you?

00:33:29.429 --> 00:33:30.800
All right!

00:33:31.359 --> 00:33:34.629
We need music on a day like this.

00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:38.199
All right. Ms. Go.

00:33:38.439 --> 00:33:41.310
You should sing a song for Yi Chan's tutor...

00:33:41.639 --> 00:33:43.179
to welcome him!

00:33:46.350 --> 00:33:49.349
Hey, why would you want to hear this old woman sing?

00:33:49.350 --> 00:33:50.350
Come on.

00:33:51.550 --> 00:33:55.718
I like the quiet man

00:33:55.719 --> 00:33:57.490
- The quiet man - The quiet man

00:33:57.560 --> 00:34:03.359
Dressed in the yellow shirt

00:34:03.959 --> 00:34:06.769
- For some reason - For some reason

00:34:06.770 --> 00:34:09.639
- I like him - I like him

00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:12.840
- For some reason - For some reason

00:34:12.909 --> 00:34:16.209
- I fancy him - I fancy him

00:34:16.310 --> 00:34:18.979
- He is - He is

00:34:18.980 --> 00:34:21.678
- Not handsome - Not handsome

00:34:21.679 --> 00:34:22.679
Dad is...

00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:24.619
singing.

00:34:26.089 --> 00:34:28.489
With my great-grandma who passed away when I was little.

00:34:36.299 --> 00:34:37.829
My gosh, look at you.

00:34:37.830 --> 00:34:40.099
Good boy. I'm so proud of you.

00:34:40.100 --> 00:34:43.099
My sweet pumpkin. I'm so proud of you.

00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:44.900
- I heard my great-grandma... - Oh, my.

00:34:45.869 --> 00:34:47.940
checked multiple times a day whether or not...

00:34:48.639 --> 00:34:51.239
I responded to sounds when I was a baby.

00:34:52.779 --> 00:34:56.250
You're smiling. Oh, my. Yes, my sweetheart.

00:34:58.719 --> 00:35:00.150
How much is the mackerel?

00:35:00.219 --> 00:35:01.949
Take all 3 of them for 5 dollars.

00:35:02.089 --> 00:35:03.289
Gosh, that's expensive.

00:35:03.290 --> 00:35:05.258
They're twice as big as the ones others are selling.

00:35:05.259 --> 00:35:07.859
"How much is the mackerel? That's expensive."

00:35:07.860 --> 00:35:10.630
My gosh. He's already talking?

00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:12.000
How old is he?

00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:19.440
Then...

00:35:20.369 --> 00:35:23.709
when I was old enough to communicate with adults...

00:35:23.710 --> 00:35:28.109
(Rest in Peace)

00:35:28.110 --> 00:35:29.580
We're sorry for your loss.

00:35:39.290 --> 00:35:41.730
Thank you for coming.

00:35:42.929 --> 00:35:44.028
Then she finally breathed her last,

00:35:44.029 --> 00:35:46.330
as if she could put her worries to rest.

00:35:47.299 --> 00:35:49.739
I didn't know that my dad...

00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:53.509
laughed this much...

00:35:54.210 --> 00:35:56.210
and was so chatty and loud when he was 18.

00:35:57.210 --> 00:35:58.580
So how did Dad...

00:35:59.350 --> 00:36:01.409
become deaf?

00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:05.480
Great-grandma must've been utterly heartbroken...

00:36:07.190 --> 00:36:08.719
when she saw that happen to her dear grandson.

00:36:10.290 --> 00:36:13.060
What really happened to Dad?

00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:17.500
What's wrong?

00:36:17.501 --> 00:36:19.469
Oh, my gosh. Are you crying?

00:36:19.830 --> 00:36:21.730
I'm not crying.

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:25.000
No.

00:36:26.210 --> 00:36:28.540
That's soju, not water.

00:36:32.580 --> 00:36:33.909
- My gosh. - Hey.

00:36:34.810 --> 00:36:36.019
- Oh, my. - Gosh.

00:36:36.020 --> 00:36:38.850
He's a real "one-shot, one-kill" man.

00:36:39.219 --> 00:36:41.019
A glass of soju knocked him out.

00:36:41.020 --> 00:36:43.560
It was a beer glass, not a shot glass.

00:36:43.889 --> 00:36:45.818
I told you to drink moderately.

00:36:45.819 --> 00:36:48.159
Good night, Ms. Go.

00:36:53.569 --> 00:36:54.900
My goodness.

00:36:55.799 --> 00:36:57.599
Why is he sleeping in my room, though?

00:36:57.600 --> 00:36:58.939
The storage room is empty.

00:36:58.940 --> 00:37:01.270
You can't make him sleep in the storage room.

00:37:01.670 --> 00:37:03.408
I'll paper the walls later.

00:37:03.409 --> 00:37:05.109
So share your room just until then.

00:37:05.110 --> 00:37:06.179
Grandma.

00:37:06.549 --> 00:37:08.179
Don't you know I'm very sensitive when I sleep?

00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:32.400
Gosh, it's warm.

Dad, what's this?

00:37:45.850 --> 00:37:46.850
It looks gross.

00:38:00.270 --> 00:38:01.730
How did you get that scar?

00:38:02.330 --> 00:38:03.400
This one?

00:38:04.139 --> 00:38:06.369
I was injured because of an accident.

00:38:07.639 --> 00:38:08.940
It must've hurt a lot.

00:38:09.679 --> 00:38:11.239
When did it happen?

00:38:13.279 --> 00:38:14.980
When was it?

00:38:16.219 --> 00:38:18.920
What did you say? I can't see.

00:38:19.549 --> 00:38:20.650
I can't see.

00:38:22.589 --> 00:38:23.960
Dad, I can't see.

00:38:26.690 --> 00:38:28.790
I can't see, Dad.

00:38:30.630 --> 00:38:31.630
Why?

I got a call from your mother in the morning.

00:38:59.219 --> 00:39:00.659
You're going abroad to study earlier than planned.

00:39:01.159 --> 00:39:03.460
Yes. It happened to be like that.

00:39:04.060 --> 00:39:05.500
That's good for you.

00:39:05.900 --> 00:39:08.270
It's better to go when you're even one year younger.

00:39:08.369 --> 00:39:10.469
- It'd be much easier to adapt. - Yes.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:13.770
I'm sure you'll do well.

00:39:14.369 --> 00:39:15.539
Thank you.

00:39:15.540 --> 00:39:19.380
But can you keep it a secret for a while?

00:39:21.909 --> 00:39:23.279
Those who are doing arts...

00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:25.618
are sensitive and delicate.

00:39:25.619 --> 00:39:27.048
I can't let other students...

00:39:27.049 --> 00:39:29.420
waste this important period of time because of jealousy.

00:39:30.119 --> 00:39:32.790
It's to help them focus on studying. Can you do that?

00:39:33.060 --> 00:39:34.290
I'll do as you say.

00:39:34.529 --> 00:39:38.000
That's very considerate of you, Se Gyeong.

00:39:39.969 --> 00:39:41.170
But Se Gyeong,

00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:45.199
being considerate isn't always a good thing.

00:39:46.469 --> 00:39:48.008
Because being considerate with a sense of superiority...

00:39:48.009 --> 00:39:50.710
can hurt someone's self-esteem.

00:39:52.310 --> 00:39:53.350
Excuse me?

00:39:53.909 --> 00:39:56.080
I heard that you've been very nice to Chung Ah.

00:39:56.920 --> 00:39:58.420
I thank you for that,

00:39:58.980 --> 00:40:01.719
but your sympathy will only make her weak.

00:40:02.350 --> 00:40:03.819
She needs to be stronger.

00:40:04.619 --> 00:40:07.289
I made her enter a regular school, not the one...

00:40:07.290 --> 00:40:08.290
for those with disabilities because of that.

00:40:08.291 --> 00:40:11.329
Excuse me, ma'am. I did not pity her.

00:40:11.330 --> 00:40:12.400
Okay.

00:40:12.730 --> 00:40:14.799
I think we've discussed enough about your plan for studying abroad.

00:40:15.529 --> 00:40:17.338
Can you tell your mother...

00:40:17.339 --> 00:40:19.869
that I'd like to have a meal with her before you go to the US?

00:40:21.639 --> 00:40:23.710
- Sure. - All right.

00:40:30.920 --> 00:40:31.949
Oh, my.

00:40:33.250 --> 00:40:35.089
Were you waiting for me?

00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:41.460
Why did she call you?

00:40:41.929 --> 00:40:44.830
Is it because Yi Chan from Baekwang High School trespassed?

00:40:54.739 --> 00:40:55.869
Are you curious?

00:40:56.009 --> 00:40:57.639
Nothing is free in this world.

I'm going abroad to study next week.

00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:05.779
I went to her office because of it.

00:41:06.319 --> 00:41:08.349
But I need to keep it a secret for a while.

00:41:08.350 --> 00:41:09.489
That's her order.

00:41:10.060 --> 00:41:11.190
I'm saying this only to you.

00:41:11.889 --> 00:41:12.960
It's a secret.

00:41:14.889 --> 00:41:16.630

00:51:24.569 --> 00:51:26.540
He's too handsome for that.

00:51:26.799 --> 00:51:27.810
Right.

00:51:28.270 --> 00:51:31.178
A girl came by earlier today and left this for you.

00:51:31.179 --> 00:51:32.678
She asked me to give this to you.

00:51:32.679 --> 00:51:33.880
- A girl? - Yes.

00:51:34.350 --> 00:51:35.350
I see.

(Myeongse Med School Band Golden Scalpel's 10th Concert)

00:51:48.529 --> 00:51:50.929
To be honest, I was surprised that you liked band music.

00:51:51.400 --> 00:51:53.830
I'm embarrassed to think that you didn't know much about music.

00:51:54.799 --> 00:51:56.569
Do you want to watch this band with me?

00:51:56.900 --> 00:51:57.940
From Se Gyeong.

00:52:03.110 --> 00:52:04.779
Sir, I can't work today.

00:52:05.080 --> 00:52:07.080
He'll fill in for me. Okay?

00:52:07.880 --> 00:52:09.879
Hey, where are you going again? Darn it.

00:52:09.880 --> 00:52:11.020
No!

00:52:11.580 --> 00:52:12.650
Are you going somewhere?

00:52:14.520 --> 00:52:16.119
Yes. I must get going.

00:52:16.619 --> 00:52:18.758
- Can we order now? - Can we order?

00:52:18.759 --> 00:52:19.888
- I don't work here. - Me first.

00:52:19.889 --> 00:52:22.059
- Sir, I'm not a good worker. - Take my order first.

00:52:22.060 --> 00:52:23.928
- I'll go first. - I don't like ice cream either.

00:52:23.929 --> 00:52:25.158
- I'm a customer here too. - You're so handsome.

00:52:25.159 --> 00:52:27.798
- You're so handsome. - So handsome.

00:52:27.799 --> 00:52:29.269
Thank you. But I...

00:52:29.270 --> 00:52:30.439
- I'm also a customer. - He's so handsome.

Keeps calling me

The woman I keep calling

00:53:26.719 --> 00:53:29.429
Tries to avoid me

00:53:29.759 --> 00:53:33.798
I see a lot of attractive women on the street

00:53:33.799 --> 00:53:37.369
But whenever I go on blind dates

00:53:37.799 --> 00:53:44.210

- To date someone - Isn't he really hot?

I find attractive

00:53:57.719 --> 00:54:02.359

Gosh, it's so far.

00:54:26.449 --> 00:54:27.619
I might die, trying to climb...

this uphill path.

Remember the guy I told you about?

A lunatic is trying to win over Se Gyeong.

How did you know about this concert?

00:55:19.869 --> 00:55:21.540
You sent me the invitation.

00:55:23.210 --> 00:55:24.409
To tell you the truth,

00:55:25.179 --> 00:55:27.549
I didn't think I'd be able to see you before the festival.

00:55:28.080 --> 00:55:29.408
Thank you for inviting me.

00:55:29.409 --> 00:55:30.850
I didn't invite you here!

00:55:33.520 --> 00:55:35.319
Let me make myself clear.

00:55:35.520 --> 00:55:37.318
I never invited you here.

00:55:37.319 --> 00:55:38.719
Are you delusional now?

00:55:38.889 --> 00:55:41.060
What are you talking about? I definitely have...

00:55:41.529 --> 00:55:44.129
the invitation ticket and the letter you wrote to me.

00:55:44.130 --> 00:55:46.130
Please this is enough!

You.

00:55:56.069 --> 00:55:57.508
Didn't you promise me...

00:55:57.509 --> 00:55:59.080
that you wouldn't show up in front of me?

00:55:59.239 --> 00:56:01.610
You said you always kept your promises.

Do you have a memory loss?

00:56:04.420 --> 00:56:06.048
It's not that.

I don't know where things went south.

00:56:07.819 --> 00:56:10.589
Are you even interested in making band music?

00:56:11.190 --> 00:56:13.588
You just want to win over girls with your band.

00:56:13.589 --> 00:56:15.088
You don't even have a band.

00:56:15.089 --> 00:56:17.029
Who said he didn't have a band?

00:56:24.299 --> 00:56:25.299
We meet again.

00:56:25.400 --> 00:56:27.040
Although you don't seem all that happy to meet me.

You two...

00:56:35.409 --> 00:56:37.880
weren't even listening to my warning even for a second.

00:56:38.350 --> 00:56:39.380
All right.

00:56:39.920 --> 00:56:41.690
Nice to meet you. My name is On Ji Hwan.

00:56:42.449 --> 00:56:44.920
I didn't know that Se Gyeong had friends who were in a band.

00:56:46.360 --> 00:56:48.888
Since you missed our concert, would you be up for a jam session?

00:56:48.889 --> 00:56:50.559
Ji Hwan. You don't have to waste your time.

00:56:50.560 --> 00:56:51.630
Why not?

00:56:52.730 --> 00:56:55.600
Can I borrow the guitar?

00:56:57.199 --> 00:56:58.669
Do you want to pick the song?

00:56:58.670 --> 00:57:00.669
You can start. Then we'll follow your lead.

Hey, what's your plan?

00:57:08.509 --> 00:57:09.548
What's "jam?"

00:57:09.549 --> 00:57:11.580
I only know strawberry jam.

00:57:12.679 --> 00:57:13.818
Just do what you've been doing.

00:57:13.819 --> 00:57:15.818
Do what you did last night. Just have fun.

00:57:15.819 --> 00:57:16.819
That's what bands do.

Go ahead.

00:57:45.319 --> 00:57:49.449
I like the quiet man,

00:57:51.190 --> 00:57:55.659
Dressed in the yellow shirt

00:57:57.230 --> 00:58:01.830
For some reason, I like him

00:58:03.469 --> 00:58:07.810
For some reason, I fancy him

00:58:09.710 --> 00:58:14.210
He's not handsome

00:58:15.779 --> 00:58:21.290
But he looks manly

00:58:21.920 --> 00:58:26.589
I like him

00:58:28.060 --> 00:58:32.529
For some reason, I fancy him

00:58:34.270 --> 00:58:40.238
I have this strange feeling in my heart

00:58:40.239 --> 00:58:42.868
- I've never felt - No way. He's pretty good!

00:58:42.869 --> 00:58:45.909
This way before

00:58:46.610 --> 00:58:52.279
I wonder

00:58:52.779 --> 00:58:58.290
If he likes me back

00:58:58.759 --> 00:59:03.259
I like the quiet man

Yes!

I can't believe this.

00:59:39.330 --> 00:59:41.569
I'm playing music with my dad.

00:59:42.199 --> 00:59:44.069
My dad is listening to me play.

01:00:09.460 --> 01:00:10.529
You were pretty good.

01:00:11.029 --> 01:00:12.699
I told you I played.

Hey. You know,

01:00:18.569 --> 01:00:21.669
you said that you wanted to join our band in place of Yoon Dong Jin.

01:00:21.670 --> 01:00:23.309
You know your band, First Love Memory Manipulators...

01:00:23.310 --> 01:00:25.079
Yes. That's the name.

01:00:25.080 --> 01:00:26.408
Are you still interested in...

01:00:26.409 --> 01:00:28.080
- Do you have to do that? - What?

01:00:28.980 --> 01:00:30.548
How many times must I tell you?

01:00:30.549 --> 01:00:32.718
I'll do it. I must.

01:00:32.719 --> 01:00:33.920
For Choi Se Gyeong?

01:00:34.389 --> 01:00:36.089
You still want to form a band after all that humiliation?

01:00:36.420 --> 01:00:37.489
Yes.

01:00:38.319 --> 01:00:40.319
It's also for the last days of my youth.

01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:44.060
As soon as I graduate from high school,

01:00:44.799 --> 01:00:46.600
I won't go to college. I'll get a job to make money.

01:00:47.199 --> 01:00:48.830
After I work my butt off and save money,

01:00:50.100 --> 01:00:52.440
I'll get back the restaurant...

01:00:53.239 --> 01:00:55.369
my dad made her lose.

01:00:56.610 --> 01:00:57.679
This means...

01:00:58.179 --> 01:01:01.279
high school will be the last time I will be in school.

01:01:01.980 --> 01:01:04.480
Therefore, my days must twinkle as radiantly as possible.

01:01:05.049 --> 01:01:06.749
I'll do everything I can.

01:01:06.750 --> 01:01:08.689
Be it love or the band.

01:01:08.690 --> 01:01:10.790
I'll do everything that will make my life twinkle.

01:01:16.759 --> 01:01:17.799
Hey, wait.

01:01:19.400 --> 01:01:21.429
Watch out! No!

01:01:22.770 --> 01:01:24.000
Darn it.

01:01:27.940 --> 01:01:31.040
Dad, how did you get that scar?

01:01:32.739 --> 01:01:33.810
When I was young,

01:01:34.750 --> 01:01:36.249
I was in a big accident.

01:01:36.250 --> 01:01:38.449
I was in 11th grade then.

01:01:45.989 --> 01:01:47.659
Goodness.

01:01:47.889 --> 01:01:49.389
Hey, what's wrong with you?

01:01:49.489 --> 01:01:51.299
Are you crazy? Are you a pervert?

01:01:53.400 --> 01:01:54.429
The scar isn't there.

01:01:55.500 --> 01:01:56.500
What scar?

01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:08.250
The accident he told me about hasn't happened yet.

I must do whatever it takes to change his future.

01:02:49.250 --> 01:02:52.019
That's the reason I travelled back in time to 1995.

01:02:52.020 --> 01:02:53.059
Thanks to you,

Se Gyeong thinks I'm the biggest loser.

01:02:55.190 --> 01:02:56.229
Are you happy now?

01:02:56.230 --> 01:02:58.559
What's the point? She's not here. She went abroad to study.

01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:01.769
Will anyone be truly sad about my departure?

01:03:01.770 --> 01:03:03.198
The almighty guitarist, Kang Hyun Yul,

01:03:03.199 --> 01:03:04.499
is going to battle someone.

01:03:04.500 --> 01:03:06.670
Let's not try hard. Let's just do well.

01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:10.509
I must find Mom no matter what, so they can meet sooner.

01:03:11.179 --> 01:03:12.279
What did you just say?

01:03:12.739 --> 01:03:15.150
Who went where?
