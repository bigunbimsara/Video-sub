WEBVTT

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:36.015
{\an8}I…

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:38.977
{\an8}think I know.

00:00:40.228 --> 00:00:41.312
{\an8}Sorry?

00:00:44.274 --> 00:00:47.902
{\an8}The person who came to my place that day,

00:00:49.654 --> 00:00:50.864
{\an8}I think I know who it was.

00:01:00.832 --> 00:01:02.000
{\an8}Yes, Young-bin.

00:01:04.043 --> 00:01:05.211
{\an8}What?

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:12.135
{\an8}Mr. Choi, can you hear me?

00:01:12.218 --> 00:01:14.762
{\an8}If you can, blink once.

00:01:18.808 --> 00:01:20.185
- Jae-hee!
- Jae-hee.

00:01:20.268 --> 00:01:21.686
Are you starting to come around?

00:01:41.748 --> 00:01:42.874
Jae-hee.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.001
La-ik.

00:01:45.501 --> 00:01:46.419
Yes.

00:01:47.587 --> 00:01:49.214
Why am I here?

00:01:51.507 --> 00:01:52.425
Where's Hye-joo?

00:02:02.477 --> 00:02:04.687
I'm sorry,

00:02:05.271 --> 00:02:08.191
but the patient needs rest.

00:02:08.274 --> 00:02:09.817
Please step outside.

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.164
Why would he ask for Hye-joo?

00:02:23.248 --> 00:02:25.124
What happened that night?

00:02:25.208 --> 00:02:26.251
Yeah, what happened?

00:02:27.919 --> 00:02:29.921
Do you know something?

00:02:42.308 --> 00:02:45.603
It's a relief that Jae-hee woke up.

00:02:55.196 --> 00:02:56.114
About that accessory,

00:02:57.907 --> 00:02:58.950
that…

00:03:01.119 --> 00:03:03.329
was something Hye-joo and I got together.

00:03:08.251 --> 00:03:09.252
What's this?

00:03:09.335 --> 00:03:11.796
These are our matching piercings.
Cute, right?

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:13.673
So beautiful.

00:03:13.756 --> 00:03:15.008
I worked so hard to get these!

00:03:15.591 --> 00:03:17.343
<i>She ordered them herself.</i>

00:03:18.177 --> 00:03:20.430
<i>I heard only two existed</i>
<i>in the whole country.</i>

00:03:21.472 --> 00:03:22.932
Let's wear these every day.

00:03:23.516 --> 00:03:26.644
<i>When we broke up,</i>

00:03:26.728 --> 00:03:28.730
<i>I took mine off and locked it in my safe.</i>

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.402
Then the one the police seized
wasn't yours.

00:03:37.864 --> 00:03:40.074
We can't be certain yet, but…

00:03:40.158 --> 00:03:43.202
if Hye-joo entered your house that night,

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.289
it could be connected
to the door-lock sound we heard.

00:03:53.588 --> 00:03:54.422
La-ik.

00:03:56.674 --> 00:03:59.302
I think we should tell the police.

00:04:02.847 --> 00:04:05.141
Yeah. We have to.

00:04:06.642 --> 00:04:08.603
I don't have time to waver now.

00:04:09.437 --> 00:04:10.521
We came this far

00:04:11.481 --> 00:04:12.899
to find the truth.

00:04:20.031 --> 00:04:22.533
It's late. You should go in.

00:04:25.703 --> 00:04:26.579
Go ahead.

00:04:28.998 --> 00:04:31.876
Okay. Get home safe.

00:04:43.096 --> 00:04:44.263
Bye.

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:39.986
Yes, Chung-jae.

00:05:40.069 --> 00:05:42.655
<i>If you're still up,</i>
<i>could you come down for a minute?</i>

00:05:42.738 --> 00:05:44.782
<i>There's something I want to show you.</i>

00:05:46.742 --> 00:05:47.702
What is it?

00:05:47.785 --> 00:05:50.371
You told me to check
with the residents last time,

00:05:50.454 --> 00:05:52.331
so I looked into it.

00:05:52.415 --> 00:05:54.792
Turns out the first floor
is pretty close to the garden.

00:05:54.876 --> 00:05:57.336
And I remembered Jae-hee
saying he heard something outside.

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:59.672
So I kept digging.

00:06:00.464 --> 00:06:03.718
I found a house with a security camera
facing that direction.

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:06.804
So I pulled the footage.

00:06:16.189 --> 00:06:17.398
Did you see it? This part.

00:06:19.066 --> 00:06:21.235
If that's a person, it's weird
they're walking around

00:06:21.319 --> 00:06:22.820
in heavy rain with no umbrella.

00:06:24.572 --> 00:06:27.867
Comparing with the structure beside them,
height is maybe low-160s.

00:06:28.784 --> 00:06:30.036
Pretty small build.

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:31.913
If it's a man, he's very small.

00:06:32.538 --> 00:06:33.414
And if it's a woman?

00:06:35.875 --> 00:06:39.795
Hye-joo may have been
at La-ik's house that night.

00:06:41.422 --> 00:06:42.673
Hye-joo?

00:06:43.716 --> 00:06:45.801
But didn't she say
she met La-ik outside that night?

00:06:48.346 --> 00:06:51.682
And earlier, when Jae-hee woke up,

00:06:52.308 --> 00:06:54.143
the first person he asked for was Hye-joo.

00:06:56.938 --> 00:06:58.231
It's not definitive yet,

00:06:58.314 --> 00:07:00.358
but this could also
be circumstantial evidence.

00:07:02.568 --> 00:07:04.487
Given everything, I'll dig further.

00:07:06.405 --> 00:07:07.240
Thank you.

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:10.535
I just don't like him, okay?

00:07:11.244 --> 00:07:14.789
La-ik needs to be cleared fast
so he can disappear from your life.

00:07:15.998 --> 00:07:18.125
Then maybe I can…

00:07:19.126 --> 00:07:20.127
What?

00:07:21.254 --> 00:07:23.381
Anyway, I'll tell you if I find more.

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:27.468
I backed up the footage.
Share it with the investigation team.

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:34.433
We actually thought it was strange too,

00:07:35.685 --> 00:07:39.105
the way he asked for Hye-joo
the moment he woke up.

00:07:40.022 --> 00:07:42.733
And with this footage
and the accessory you found,

00:07:43.484 --> 00:07:47.905
we should look into that angle.

00:07:50.366 --> 00:07:54.870
But Prosecutor Kwak
is still insisting on indicting La-ik.

00:07:54.954 --> 00:07:57.748
He says Jae-hee's statement alone
isn't enough to change the suspect.

00:07:57.832 --> 00:08:02.211
And even if Hye-joo
is connected to Jae-hee's case,

00:08:02.795 --> 00:08:08.551
it doesn't directly tie her
to Woo-seong's murder.

00:08:08.634 --> 00:08:11.304
But wasn't Do La-ik indicted

00:08:11.387 --> 00:08:13.931
because he believed
La-ik was involved in Jae-hee's case?

00:08:14.015 --> 00:08:15.266
Exactly.

00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:16.934
But…

00:08:17.018 --> 00:08:20.187
Prosecutor Kwak keeps pushing
this forced indictment.

00:08:21.397 --> 00:08:22.857
No idea if it's pride or what,

00:08:23.441 --> 00:08:25.318
but he won't back down.

00:08:28.779 --> 00:08:30.031
Excuse me.

00:08:33.034 --> 00:08:34.035
Hello.

00:08:38.706 --> 00:08:39.832
Jae-hee?

00:08:41.042 --> 00:08:42.209
Yeah.

00:08:49.759 --> 00:08:50.635
You're here.

00:08:52.261 --> 00:08:53.596
Where's Choi Jae-hee?

00:08:53.679 --> 00:08:54.889
He's waiting for you inside.

00:08:56.307 --> 00:08:59.602
He keeps insisting
he'll only give his statement to you.

00:09:00.186 --> 00:09:01.354
Open the door.

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:17.662
{\an8}CHOI JAE-HEE

00:09:17.745 --> 00:09:18.954
{\an8}It's just…

00:09:20.373 --> 00:09:22.208
I don't really remember

00:09:23.918 --> 00:09:25.503
what happened.

00:09:32.218 --> 00:09:34.470
I don't even know

00:09:35.513 --> 00:09:36.347
why I woke up here.

00:09:38.766 --> 00:09:40.768
So please, just leave me alone.

00:09:40.851 --> 00:09:41.727
<i>That night…</i>

00:09:41.811 --> 00:09:43.646
Stop coming after me!

00:09:43.729 --> 00:09:46.315
<i>After I hung up with Director Geum,</i>

00:10:10.589 --> 00:10:13.718
<i>Hye-joo contacted me.</i>

00:10:15.302 --> 00:10:17.346
<i>Out of nowhere, she wanted to meet me.</i>

00:10:18.723 --> 00:10:20.558
It's been a while.

00:10:21.851 --> 00:10:22.727
Three years?

00:10:23.686 --> 00:10:27.064
Yeah. I got back to Korea not long ago.

00:10:30.359 --> 00:10:31.485
But what's going on?

00:10:35.823 --> 00:10:37.867
Woo-seong's death was shocking enough.

00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:39.493
Then you and La-ik.

00:10:40.327 --> 00:10:42.663
It's all over the news.
I was really worried.

00:10:44.999 --> 00:10:45.958
Are you okay?

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:51.464
What happened?

00:10:52.173 --> 00:10:54.216
What's going on?

00:10:55.176 --> 00:10:56.427
Tell me.

00:10:57.303 --> 00:10:59.638
It's complicated.

00:11:00.306 --> 00:11:01.849
I don't know what's going on either.

00:11:08.606 --> 00:11:10.107
Is that why you came out here?

00:11:12.026 --> 00:11:16.322
This place is near
where you guys had your first show.

00:11:17.239 --> 00:11:18.365
Right.

00:11:18.949 --> 00:11:21.035
I just really missed Woo-seong.

00:11:22.953 --> 00:11:24.997
And I didn't have anywhere else to go.

00:11:25.581 --> 00:11:28.626
The prosecutors keep treating me
like I'm the culprit.

00:11:30.044 --> 00:11:31.295
That's ridiculous.

00:11:31.921 --> 00:11:34.423
There's no way.
You're too soft-hearted for that.

00:11:36.634 --> 00:11:38.511
But still, it feels like
everyone suspects me.

00:11:39.303 --> 00:11:40.179
I'm really not.

00:11:41.263 --> 00:11:43.307
I know. You'd never do it.

00:11:47.186 --> 00:11:50.564
But that night, you went to La-ik's place.

00:11:51.649 --> 00:11:54.735
I think that's
why people are misunderstanding.

00:11:56.904 --> 00:11:59.323
But it will clear up.
They'll see you're innocent.

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:05.371
How do you know
that I went to his place that night?

00:12:12.086 --> 00:12:14.922
What do you mean? It was on the news.

00:12:16.215 --> 00:12:17.424
The news?

00:12:18.425 --> 00:12:21.720
Of course. How else would I know?

00:12:23.514 --> 00:12:24.598
Jae-hee.

00:12:24.682 --> 00:12:27.726
You probably haven't eaten, right?
Let's get dinner.

00:12:29.186 --> 00:12:30.771
Okay.

00:12:35.025 --> 00:12:36.902
You go first, I'll follow.

00:12:38.237 --> 00:12:39.488
Let's get something nice.

00:12:40.531 --> 00:12:41.365
I'll treat you.

00:12:59.758 --> 00:13:01.302
<i>Something felt wrong…</i>

00:13:02.678 --> 00:13:03.804
<i>that night.</i>

00:13:10.811 --> 00:13:12.396
Woo-seong said

00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:15.024
he was going to meet La-ik,

00:13:15.899 --> 00:13:17.901
<i>so I waited at the hospital.</i>

00:13:17.985 --> 00:13:18.819
STILL TALKING?

00:13:18.902 --> 00:13:20.571
<i>But he never called, so…</i>

00:13:21.488 --> 00:13:23.699
<i>I went by La-ik's place for a moment.</i>

00:13:32.666 --> 00:13:33.751
Woo-seong!

00:13:33.834 --> 00:13:36.503
But I never told anyone that.

00:13:38.088 --> 00:13:39.673
I was afraid people would suspect me.

00:13:41.717 --> 00:13:43.927
But I'm not sure how Hye-joo knows that.

00:13:44.887 --> 00:13:46.805
<i>I'm in a situation, and I need some help.</i>

00:13:47.556 --> 00:13:48.641
Yeah, so…

00:13:50.142 --> 00:13:51.769
Aren't you leaving?

00:13:51.852 --> 00:13:52.686
I'll go.

00:14:08.577 --> 00:14:09.953
<i>After that,</i>

00:14:11.246 --> 00:14:12.831
<i>I don't remember anything.</i>

00:14:14.208 --> 00:14:16.251
But thinking about it,

00:14:17.086 --> 00:14:19.713
the fact that she suddenly asked to meet,

00:14:21.090 --> 00:14:23.968
me waking up here afterward,

00:14:25.094 --> 00:14:26.136
none of it makes sense.

00:14:29.223 --> 00:14:30.349
Prosecutor,

00:14:31.183 --> 00:14:34.561
do you know why I'm telling you all this?

00:14:36.355 --> 00:14:38.023
You once told me

00:14:39.775 --> 00:14:41.527
that even if someone's innocent,

00:14:42.027 --> 00:14:44.822
everything depends

00:14:44.905 --> 00:14:46.615
on how you choose to see it.

00:14:46.699 --> 00:14:49.243
There is no such thing
as an absolute truth.

00:14:50.035 --> 00:14:51.870
The truth is always relative.

00:14:51.954 --> 00:14:53.664
Depending on your perspective,

00:14:53.747 --> 00:14:55.833
it can change.

00:14:57.543 --> 00:15:00.796
You said there's no absolute truth.

00:15:02.047 --> 00:15:03.424
But you're wrong.

00:15:04.675 --> 00:15:05.676
Truth is singular.

00:15:07.136 --> 00:15:09.972
And I never wrote a suicide note.

00:15:10.055 --> 00:15:11.724
I never attempted suicide.

00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:14.893
That is the truth.

00:15:17.438 --> 00:15:18.731
So please,

00:15:18.814 --> 00:15:21.025
look at what's real.

00:15:23.110 --> 00:15:24.945
Don't turn innocent people…

00:15:26.321 --> 00:15:27.906
into criminals.

00:15:37.791 --> 00:15:39.877
<i>I looked into Hong Hye-joo.</i>

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:42.087
<i>It's not directly related to the case,</i>

00:15:42.171 --> 00:15:43.630
<i>but I think you should see this.</i>

00:15:43.714 --> 00:15:45.299
PATIENT MARKED EMOTIONALLY UNSTABLE

00:15:57.102 --> 00:15:58.187
Yes, La-ik.

00:15:58.270 --> 00:16:00.773
I'm at the hospital right now.

00:16:00.856 --> 00:16:04.735
The police and the prosecutor are here,
so I wanted to check if you knew.

00:16:05.444 --> 00:16:07.237
I heard that
at the police station earlier.

00:16:07.321 --> 00:16:09.364
They said he's giving his statement now.

00:16:10.574 --> 00:16:13.494
Since I'm involved in the case,
I guess I'm not allowed to see him.

00:16:14.787 --> 00:16:18.040
But Young-bin's here,
so I thought I'd check in on him.

00:16:19.458 --> 00:16:20.292
Are you okay?

00:16:21.919 --> 00:16:23.212
Yeah.

00:16:24.797 --> 00:16:26.048
But…

00:16:26.131 --> 00:16:29.301
if Hye-joo really has
something to do with Jae-hee,

00:16:29.927 --> 00:16:31.762
<i>shouldn't we tell the prosecution?</i>

00:16:33.097 --> 00:16:35.057
She said she was leaving the country soon.

00:16:36.934 --> 00:16:38.852
Young-bin's here.
I'll call you back later.

00:16:39.770 --> 00:16:41.647
Okay. Call me later.

00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:46.443
MEDICAL REPORT

00:16:51.907 --> 00:16:54.201
The doctor said
we don't have to worry too much.

00:16:56.078 --> 00:16:59.540
He's fully conscious now,
and he's slowly recovering.

00:17:04.211 --> 00:17:05.129
I'm sorry.

00:17:09.842 --> 00:17:11.218
Why would you be sorry?

00:17:12.928 --> 00:17:13.887
I just…

00:17:14.888 --> 00:17:16.306
feel like all of this is my fault.

00:17:17.891 --> 00:17:21.145
I've done nothing but hurt you guys.

00:17:23.522 --> 00:17:25.816
I had no idea how hard it was for Jae-hee

00:17:27.067 --> 00:17:28.819
or what you all were going through.

00:17:31.155 --> 00:17:32.865
Not knowing any of that.

00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:40.706
Don't say that.

00:17:42.958 --> 00:17:46.128
We didn't understand
what you were feeling either.

00:17:48.213 --> 00:17:51.466
And Jae-hee's probably feeling
sorry toward you too, deep down.

00:17:56.471 --> 00:17:58.640
But seriously, what did happen that night?

00:17:59.641 --> 00:18:02.519
If only we had Woo-seong's phone…

00:18:05.147 --> 00:18:08.984
He used to record everything out of habit.

00:18:10.235 --> 00:18:12.613
If anything was saved on there,

00:18:12.696 --> 00:18:15.240
we'd finally know the truth.

00:18:25.042 --> 00:18:26.084
<i>Prosecutor,</i>

00:18:26.627 --> 00:18:29.213
I've told you everything I know.

00:18:30.214 --> 00:18:33.383
Please investigate
Hong Hye-joo properly,

00:18:34.218 --> 00:18:35.636
so the truth can come out.

00:18:39.723 --> 00:18:40.891
Sir.

00:18:42.267 --> 00:18:44.186
Attorney Maeng Se-na is here.

00:18:55.906 --> 00:18:58.367
{\an8}This is all circumstantial.

00:18:58.450 --> 00:19:00.827
Nothing here objectively proves anything.

00:19:00.911 --> 00:19:03.330
- It's just speculation…
- I heard you met Jae-hee.

00:19:04.081 --> 00:19:08.377
He testified that he met
Hong Hye-joo right before the accident.

00:19:08.919 --> 00:19:09.920
And these,

00:19:10.796 --> 00:19:13.590
the sound from the last call
between Director Geum and Woo-seong,

00:19:14.258 --> 00:19:17.135
the silhouette caught near the scene,

00:19:17.219 --> 00:19:19.554
the trace evidence,

00:19:19.638 --> 00:19:21.139
and this piercing…

00:19:23.183 --> 00:19:24.601
don't these strike you as strange?

00:19:24.685 --> 00:19:27.646
Not to me. I don't see anything unusual.

00:19:34.027 --> 00:19:36.321
No. You do know.

00:19:38.115 --> 00:19:39.908
You know the path you're choosing

00:19:40.534 --> 00:19:42.286
might be the wrong one.

00:19:44.371 --> 00:19:46.665
If the truth gets buried like this,

00:19:46.748 --> 00:19:49.960
someone innocent will live
their whole life carrying a crime.

00:19:50.043 --> 00:19:50.919
And I…

00:19:52.838 --> 00:19:54.923
I know exactly what that life is.

00:19:57.384 --> 00:19:59.803
A life where all you can do…

00:20:01.972 --> 00:20:03.807
is endure.

00:20:07.019 --> 00:20:07.853
Byung-gyun.

00:20:09.104 --> 00:20:09.938
Can you…

00:20:10.772 --> 00:20:13.108
really live with yourself
after pushing someone

00:20:13.775 --> 00:20:15.736
into that kind of misery?

00:20:17.279 --> 00:20:21.575
Can you carry that weight
for the rest of your life?

00:20:28.707 --> 00:20:30.334
Hye-joo is leaving the country soon.

00:20:31.335 --> 00:20:33.253
We don't have much time.

00:20:42.304 --> 00:20:43.221
Kwak Byung-gyun.

00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:46.308
You…

00:20:47.434 --> 00:20:49.269
don't have to live the way
your father did.

00:21:13.668 --> 00:21:15.087
MEDICAL REPORT

00:21:55.460 --> 00:21:59.548
<i>Woo-seong used to record</i>
<i>everything out of habit.</i>

00:22:00.173 --> 00:22:01.758
If anything was saved on there,

00:22:01.842 --> 00:22:04.261
we'd finally know the truth.

00:22:28.201 --> 00:22:29.286
<i>I'm leaving now.</i>

00:22:30.203 --> 00:22:31.329
<i>Take care.</i>

00:22:37.752 --> 00:22:39.087
MEDICAL REPORT

00:22:48.930 --> 00:22:52.350
<i>Byung-gyun, you know</i>

00:22:52.934 --> 00:22:56.104
I once dealt with something a lot like
what you're facing now.

00:22:57.355 --> 00:22:58.940
There was a suspect.

00:22:59.024 --> 00:23:01.818
No hard evidence, but a damn clear motive.

00:23:02.402 --> 00:23:04.029
But he wouldn't confess.

00:23:05.113 --> 00:23:06.656
No matter how hard we pressed,

00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:08.700
he kept claiming he was innocent.

00:23:09.826 --> 00:23:10.869
And then one day…

00:23:11.411 --> 00:23:13.038
that guy…

00:23:14.122 --> 00:23:15.624
went and hung himself in prison.

00:23:19.211 --> 00:23:22.505
Hey, wasn't that girl so pretty?

00:23:22.589 --> 00:23:24.466
- Come on.
- Hey.

00:23:34.517 --> 00:23:35.936
My father is not a murderer.

00:23:37.229 --> 00:23:39.272
- What?
- And your father knew that,

00:23:39.356 --> 00:23:41.733
but he still drove mine off a cliff.

00:23:42.317 --> 00:23:45.028
- What are you talking about?
- You want to be a prosecutor?

00:23:45.987 --> 00:23:48.615
I hope you make it.

00:23:49.199 --> 00:23:50.784
Because I want you to watch me

00:23:50.867 --> 00:23:53.328
set everything right.

00:24:10.178 --> 00:24:11.221
Kwak Byung-gyun.

00:24:12.222 --> 00:24:13.223
You…

00:24:14.599 --> 00:24:16.810
don't have to live the way
your father did.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.794
Yes, Detective Yu. It's me.

00:24:49.134 --> 00:24:50.302
Hello, La-ik.

00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:53.096
I saw your text message.

00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:55.223
Are you flying out today?

00:24:56.474 --> 00:24:58.893
Yeah. I'm leaving in a bit.

00:25:00.895 --> 00:25:04.983
I called because I need
to ask you one last thing.

00:25:06.568 --> 00:25:07.569
Something to ask?

00:25:08.570 --> 00:25:09.404
What is it?

00:25:11.072 --> 00:25:12.282
That night…

00:25:13.658 --> 00:25:15.618
The night Woo-seong died,

00:25:16.870 --> 00:25:17.954
did you come to my place?

00:25:20.707 --> 00:25:22.500
<i>Just tell me the truth.</i>

00:25:23.335 --> 00:25:24.586
Were you at my place?

00:25:27.756 --> 00:25:30.425
No. I wasn't.

00:25:31.134 --> 00:25:35.013
I don't know what you heard
or who said what,

00:25:36.890 --> 00:25:38.224
<i>but just remember this.</i>

00:25:38.308 --> 00:25:41.978
Whatever people are saying,
none of it is true.

00:25:42.729 --> 00:25:43.646
You know that, right?

00:26:09.047 --> 00:26:10.298
Hong Hye-joo!

00:26:43.915 --> 00:26:46.209
I couldn't reach you at all,
I got worried…

00:26:57.554 --> 00:26:59.681
What's wrong? Did something happen?

00:27:01.891 --> 00:27:02.934
No.

00:27:03.643 --> 00:27:04.769
I just…

00:27:05.645 --> 00:27:07.063
missed you so much.

00:27:08.898 --> 00:27:09.983
And then you showed up.

00:27:11.609 --> 00:27:12.569
That's all.

00:27:13.445 --> 00:27:14.279
What's wrong?

00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:19.200
You said you'd call me back,
but then you wouldn't answer.

00:27:19.284 --> 00:27:20.827
You were on the phone the whole time.

00:27:24.372 --> 00:27:26.624
Come in.
There's something I want to show you.

00:27:34.048 --> 00:27:36.468
So you're saying Woo-seong's phone

00:27:36.551 --> 00:27:39.846
might have been automatically synced
with this cloud storage?

00:27:42.265 --> 00:27:44.392
Woo-seong used to record everything.

00:27:45.602 --> 00:27:48.354
And the more I thought about it,
if someone took his phone,

00:27:48.438 --> 00:27:50.398
maybe there was something on it.

00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:54.986
So I've been trying to get into this. But…

00:27:55.069 --> 00:27:55.904
WRONG PASSWORD

00:27:57.280 --> 00:27:58.781
I can't crack his password.

00:28:01.159 --> 00:28:02.994
I thought I knew him better than anyone,

00:28:03.077 --> 00:28:05.914
so I tried everything I could think of.

00:28:07.165 --> 00:28:08.291
But nothing works.

00:28:11.085 --> 00:28:12.795
I told you to answer clearly!

00:28:14.255 --> 00:28:17.509
Where exactly were you on the night
Choi Jae-hee had the accident?

00:28:17.592 --> 00:28:19.177
I already told you.

00:28:19.761 --> 00:28:22.597
I attended a company event
and went straight home.

00:28:24.015 --> 00:28:26.059
You can check the CCTV.

00:28:27.852 --> 00:28:29.354
Oh, right.

00:28:29.437 --> 00:28:31.648
Did you fail to secure that?

00:28:34.317 --> 00:28:36.569
We secured something better than CCTV.

00:28:38.071 --> 00:28:39.656
Choi Jae-hee's statement.

00:28:42.075 --> 00:28:43.993
He woke up.

00:28:45.036 --> 00:28:45.870
Yesterday.

00:28:48.665 --> 00:28:49.791
Did he?

00:28:53.503 --> 00:28:54.379
That's good to hear.

00:28:55.839 --> 00:28:57.882
According to him,

00:28:57.966 --> 00:29:00.176
he met you that night,

00:29:00.260 --> 00:29:02.428
right before the crash.

00:29:02.512 --> 00:29:03.763
And…

00:29:05.139 --> 00:29:05.974
these.

00:29:06.933 --> 00:29:11.896
A figure passing near the scene
whose build matches yours.

00:29:12.522 --> 00:29:14.065
A piercing found at the site

00:29:15.650 --> 00:29:17.735
that belongs to you.

00:29:18.987 --> 00:29:22.198
All of this is pointing straight at you.

00:29:23.992 --> 00:29:25.785
How do you explain that?

00:29:29.247 --> 00:29:32.584
Are you shaken by that kind of evidence?

00:29:33.334 --> 00:29:35.795
- What?
- Jae-hee named me

00:29:35.879 --> 00:29:39.257
because he knows I gave a statement
that wasn't in his favor.

00:29:40.425 --> 00:29:42.135
And that piercing?

00:29:42.719 --> 00:29:45.972
I gave it to La-ik myself that night.

00:29:47.348 --> 00:29:49.017
We argued, and I was furious.

00:29:51.769 --> 00:29:53.521
Prosecutor…

00:29:57.817 --> 00:29:59.402
I didn't do it.

00:30:00.904 --> 00:30:02.447
And honestly…

00:30:03.114 --> 00:30:04.908
you're better off if I'm not the culprit.

00:30:07.535 --> 00:30:08.578
Wouldn't you agree?

00:30:16.961 --> 00:30:18.838
Wow, she's no ordinary one.

00:30:18.922 --> 00:30:21.549
If we could get a confession,
we might get something.

00:30:33.061 --> 00:30:34.479
What do you think you're doing?

00:30:35.772 --> 00:30:37.941
Release Hye-joo. Right now.

00:30:38.024 --> 00:30:39.275
I can't do that.

00:30:40.193 --> 00:30:43.321
She's a prime suspect.
And we have evidence.

00:30:43.404 --> 00:30:46.074
It's not decisive evidence!

00:30:50.078 --> 00:30:51.579
I told you.

00:30:51.663 --> 00:30:55.792
Cases aren't won with evidence.
They're won by pushing through with power.

00:30:57.418 --> 00:31:00.088
Release her immediately--

00:31:00.171 --> 00:31:01.005
Father.

00:31:02.715 --> 00:31:04.550
Is this how you've lived your entire life?

00:31:06.386 --> 00:31:09.180
Suppressing the truth with force?

00:31:09.889 --> 00:31:11.641
Then teach me.

00:31:12.225 --> 00:31:14.727
Teach me how to pretend
I don't see the truth.

00:31:14.811 --> 00:31:16.688
How to look the truth in the eye

00:31:17.355 --> 00:31:18.940
and still act like I know nothing.

00:31:20.775 --> 00:31:22.485
Please teach me.

00:31:31.369 --> 00:31:35.081
She will be released soon.

00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:38.459
There weren't even enough grounds
for an emergency arrest.

00:31:39.919 --> 00:31:43.172
What you're doing isn't an investigation,
it's a tantrum.

00:31:44.298 --> 00:31:45.967
And no matter what it takes,

00:31:46.050 --> 00:31:50.304
I will stop
this stupid mistake you're making.

00:31:52.181 --> 00:31:54.767
So you're saying you'd block your own son

00:31:54.851 --> 00:31:57.687
if it meant protecting your success.

00:31:58.938 --> 00:32:01.649
I see. Thank you.

00:32:02.316 --> 00:32:04.861
That last little bit of doubt I had,

00:32:04.944 --> 00:32:06.612
you just erased it completely.

00:32:09.615 --> 00:32:10.700
What?

00:32:10.783 --> 00:32:12.785
You walk your path, Father.

00:32:12.869 --> 00:32:15.288
And from here on, I'm going to walk mine.

00:32:16.998 --> 00:32:18.916
And I'll fight you.

00:32:20.043 --> 00:32:21.335
For the first time in my life.

00:32:42.106 --> 00:32:43.483
KANG WOO-SEONG

00:32:48.488 --> 00:32:50.573
<i>The secret in Woo-seong's song.</i>

00:32:52.492 --> 00:32:58.873
<i>Do you know where that post about</i>
<i>Woo-seong's hidden secret is?</i>

00:33:01.167 --> 00:33:02.001
{\an8}LIKE

00:33:05.129 --> 00:33:07.882
<i>Like, can I ask you one thing?</i>

00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:23.314
<i>Hey! Why'd you disappear?</i>
<i>You even deleted your account!</i>

00:33:23.397 --> 00:33:25.024
<i>What's going on?</i>

00:33:25.108 --> 00:33:26.109
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

00:33:26.984 --> 00:33:28.861
<i>Sorry to bother you out of nowhere,</i>

00:33:28.945 --> 00:33:31.823
<i>but about that hidden message you said</i>
<i>was in Woo-seong's song,</i>

00:33:31.906 --> 00:33:34.617
<i>can you tell me more about it?</i>

00:33:35.576 --> 00:33:38.079
{\an8}<i>Oh, that?</i>

00:33:38.162 --> 00:33:41.165
{\an8}<i>It's only in the album.</i>

00:33:41.249 --> 00:33:42.416
{\an8}<i>The album?</i>

00:33:43.668 --> 00:33:44.961
<i>Yeah, it's only on the CD.</i>

00:33:57.348 --> 00:33:59.725
Yes, La-ik, can you come over
for a moment?

00:33:59.809 --> 00:34:02.228
I think I might've found something.

00:34:06.149 --> 00:34:07.108
Yes.

00:34:12.071 --> 00:34:13.739
My friend said

00:34:13.823 --> 00:34:15.867
Woo-seong hid a secret message

00:34:15.950 --> 00:34:18.828
in one of the songs he composed.

00:34:18.911 --> 00:34:20.663
- A message?
- Yes.

00:34:20.746 --> 00:34:24.959
It's not in the streaming version.
You can find it if you listen to the CD.

00:34:25.042 --> 00:34:26.127
If you pay attention,

00:34:26.210 --> 00:34:29.672
there are tracks where a high-frequency
tone repeats at the end.

00:34:40.725 --> 00:34:43.477
<i>And when you run that tone</i>
<i>through a decoding app…</i>

00:34:43.561 --> 00:34:44.562
PLAY

00:34:46.731 --> 00:34:48.399
{\an8}<i>…a hidden message appears.</i>

00:34:54.447 --> 00:34:56.240
{\an8}SECOND FULL ALBUM

00:34:57.617 --> 00:35:00.453
These are the messages I've found so far.

00:35:04.332 --> 00:35:07.251
{\an8}But these are way too long
to be passwords.

00:35:08.211 --> 00:35:09.045
Right?

00:35:09.629 --> 00:35:12.465
Still, I'll check every track,
just in case.

00:35:30.983 --> 00:35:35.613
It feels kind of weird,
listening to our song like this together.

00:35:37.198 --> 00:35:39.283
Why? It's my favorite song.

00:35:44.664 --> 00:35:48.960
I had no idea
Woo-seong hid anything in his music.

00:35:50.378 --> 00:35:53.923
And the fact that fans figured it out,
that's insane.

00:35:55.758 --> 00:36:00.304
Fans want to know everything.
Even the tiniest little things.

00:36:01.264 --> 00:36:03.474
Every shade of meaning in a lyric,

00:36:03.557 --> 00:36:06.269
every tremble in a voice,

00:36:06.352 --> 00:36:08.854
every look onstage.

00:36:08.938 --> 00:36:10.773
Because all of it is him.

00:36:19.949 --> 00:36:21.701
- Did you hear that?
- Yes.

00:36:28.958 --> 00:36:32.586
PLAY

00:36:43.139 --> 00:36:45.725
Aren't these album titles?

00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:52.565
Look! The first letters.

00:37:01.449 --> 00:37:03.743
- It's the name of the first full album!
- Right.

00:37:03.826 --> 00:37:05.870
And here.

00:37:07.872 --> 00:37:11.334
That's the second album, <i>Forward.</i>

00:37:12.543 --> 00:37:13.461
And this one.

00:37:16.255 --> 00:37:20.176
It's the third album, <i>Lonely.</i>

00:37:25.598 --> 00:37:27.767
No, not that kind of thing.

00:37:27.850 --> 00:37:30.770
Our next full album
is our 10th anniversary one.

00:37:30.853 --> 00:37:33.022
We should do something really fresh.

00:37:33.105 --> 00:37:36.067
I heard that cyberpunk is the trend.

00:37:36.150 --> 00:37:39.487
Not that, since it's our 10th anniversary,

00:37:40.571 --> 00:37:42.281
I want something with a message.

00:37:43.324 --> 00:37:44.408
A message?

00:37:45.409 --> 00:37:46.285
Like what?

00:38:07.807 --> 00:38:09.225
It worked!

00:38:28.661 --> 00:38:31.414
These are the files uploaded
on the day of the incident.

00:38:31.497 --> 00:38:32.415
VOICE RECORDING

00:38:32.498 --> 00:38:35.918
I think the time is almost the same
as the estimated time of the event.

00:38:46.595 --> 00:38:48.013
VOICE RECORDING

00:38:51.225 --> 00:38:52.852
<i>Since things have turned out this way,</i>

00:38:54.019 --> 00:38:56.981
{\an8}<i>I'll take responsibility</i>
<i>for what I've done.</i>

00:38:57.606 --> 00:39:00.651
And no matter what it takes,
I'm going to break free from you.

00:39:02.820 --> 00:39:05.781
Only then can we live the way we want.

00:39:45.779 --> 00:39:48.199
- Kang Woo-seong?
- Why are you here?

00:39:53.913 --> 00:39:55.581
What are you doing?! Why are you…

00:39:55.664 --> 00:39:58.417
Isn't it obvious? I'm here to see La-ik.
La-ik!

00:39:58.501 --> 00:40:00.669
He's really drunk. He's asleep right now.

00:40:02.755 --> 00:40:03.756
La-ik.

00:40:04.256 --> 00:40:05.716
Why are you acting like this?

00:40:06.592 --> 00:40:07.843
Move.

00:40:10.554 --> 00:40:12.431
You haven't changed at all.

00:40:13.557 --> 00:40:15.518
Look who's talking.

00:40:16.810 --> 00:40:20.940
Drinking with him, pretending to listen,
pretending to care.

00:40:21.023 --> 00:40:23.651
You're still leeching off him, huh?

00:40:23.734 --> 00:40:24.693
What?

00:40:25.611 --> 00:40:26.987
La-ik!

00:40:27.071 --> 00:40:28.614
I said stop it!

00:40:28.697 --> 00:40:30.616
Why? Who do you think you are?

00:40:30.699 --> 00:40:34.370
I want to see him,
who do you think you are, stopping me?

00:40:43.254 --> 00:40:45.923
This is why I said stop, because of you!

00:40:50.553 --> 00:40:53.305
Do you know how much he has suffered
because of you?

00:40:54.098 --> 00:40:56.058
How much pain you put him through?

00:40:58.102 --> 00:41:03.274
Hye-joo, you push people until they break.

00:41:03.357 --> 00:41:07.987
No matter how much love he gives you,
you want more and more.

00:41:08.904 --> 00:41:10.948
Because you never got any love growing up.

00:41:22.334 --> 00:41:23.877
It's over.

00:41:24.670 --> 00:41:26.255
And like I told you before,

00:41:27.548 --> 00:41:29.425
he has moved on.

00:41:31.302 --> 00:41:33.304
He doesn't love you anymore.

00:41:59.496 --> 00:42:01.248
Hye-joo, you need to…

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:04.001
You…

00:42:04.835 --> 00:42:06.670
What are you doing?

00:42:08.130 --> 00:42:10.174
You said it's over.

00:42:11.967 --> 00:42:13.302
Without him,

00:42:14.720 --> 00:42:17.389
maybe it's better
if everything ends here too.

00:42:18.641 --> 00:42:19.767
Hey!

00:42:20.601 --> 00:42:23.646
Drop the knife! Drop it!

00:43:06.647 --> 00:43:07.690
Woo-seong.

00:43:21.787 --> 00:43:22.705
Woo-seong.

00:43:23.747 --> 00:43:24.998
Woo-seong!

00:43:25.708 --> 00:43:27.126
Woo-seong!

00:43:31.046 --> 00:43:32.756
Woo-seong!

00:43:34.717 --> 00:43:36.135
Woo-seong!

00:43:51.275 --> 00:43:52.443
<i>Woo-seong.</i>

00:43:53.068 --> 00:43:55.195
<i>No, Woo-seong!</i>

00:43:59.950 --> 00:44:02.703
Maybe we should stop here?

00:46:45.782 --> 00:46:46.783
Woo-seong!

00:46:54.750 --> 00:46:55.792
Woo-seong!

00:47:12.017 --> 00:47:13.018
Woo-seong!

00:47:23.695 --> 00:47:24.780
Woo-seong!

00:48:51.783 --> 00:48:53.452
CHOI JAE-HEE

00:49:09.259 --> 00:49:10.093
La-ik.

00:49:19.060 --> 00:49:20.520
I kind of…

00:49:21.980 --> 00:49:22.814
expected it.

00:49:24.858 --> 00:49:26.276
I hoped I was wrong.

00:49:42.167 --> 00:49:43.960
If this recording is released,

00:49:44.669 --> 00:49:48.256
the truth about you and Hye-joo
will become public too.

00:49:50.091 --> 00:49:51.802
Are you okay with that?

00:49:56.681 --> 00:49:57.808
No.

00:50:02.687 --> 00:50:04.439
But I'll face it.

00:50:09.069 --> 00:50:10.904
I'm done running.

00:50:12.364 --> 00:50:14.407
No matter how painful the truth is,

00:50:15.742 --> 00:50:17.118
we agreed to bring it to light.

00:50:18.954 --> 00:50:20.997
Because that's the only thing I can do

00:50:22.541 --> 00:50:24.543
for the people who loved me,

00:50:26.503 --> 00:50:28.296
and for the people who loved Woo-seong.

00:50:42.060 --> 00:50:43.728
<i>This morning, prosecutors sought</i>

00:50:43.812 --> 00:50:46.731
<i>life imprisonment</i>
<i>for the defendant, Ms. Hong,</i>

00:50:46.815 --> 00:50:49.651
<i>who has been indicted for murder</i>
<i>and attempted murder.</i>

00:50:49.734 --> 00:50:50.902
<i>It has been confirmed</i>

00:50:50.986 --> 00:50:54.364
<i>that she is the illegitimate daughter</i>
<i>of Chairman Hong of the Imhwa Group.</i>

00:51:06.501 --> 00:51:11.172
Hong Hye-joo keeps insisting
it wasn't premeditated.

00:51:11.256 --> 00:51:15.927
But when it comes to Choi Jae-hee,
it's pretty clear.

00:51:16.636 --> 00:51:18.555
<i>She'd been getting sedatives</i>
<i>from her hospital,</i>

00:51:18.638 --> 00:51:22.058
<i>and it looks like</i>
<i>she slipped them to Jae-hee.</i>

00:51:23.768 --> 00:51:26.187
She probably wanted
to frame him as the culprit.

00:51:33.904 --> 00:51:35.071
Thank you.

00:51:36.573 --> 00:51:38.408
I know you were under a lot of pressure

00:51:38.491 --> 00:51:40.702
pushing this case forward
and getting her into court.

00:51:41.494 --> 00:51:43.747
And when I asked you for help,

00:51:43.830 --> 00:51:47.500
you made the call before it was too late,
so we could catch the real culprit.

00:51:51.004 --> 00:51:52.547
So, really. Thank you.

00:51:52.631 --> 00:51:54.758
I should be the one thanking you.

00:51:57.010 --> 00:51:58.053
Honestly,

00:51:58.637 --> 00:52:01.389
this case tormented me the whole time.

00:52:02.432 --> 00:52:05.101
I couldn't admit I might be wrong,

00:52:05.685 --> 00:52:09.272
but if an innocent person
could end up paying for my mistake,

00:52:09.356 --> 00:52:12.025
I didn't know how I'd ever live with that.

00:52:13.318 --> 00:52:14.152
It scared me.

00:52:16.655 --> 00:52:20.492
But thanks to you, we caught the real one.
And I'm on the news too.

00:52:22.202 --> 00:52:24.829
I'm a hotshot prosecutor, thanks to you.

00:52:32.379 --> 00:52:33.213
I'm sorry.

00:52:35.423 --> 00:52:37.175
Your father's case,

00:52:37.801 --> 00:52:39.511
I really hope the truth comes out soon.

00:52:42.389 --> 00:52:43.223
Really.

00:52:47.769 --> 00:52:50.230
Anyway, I've said what I needed to say.

00:52:51.398 --> 00:52:53.900
I'm leaving. Take care.

00:53:06.663 --> 00:53:08.707
KANG WOO-SEONG
YOUR TIME LIVES ON IN YOUR SONG

00:53:41.031 --> 00:53:42.115
Why are you here?

00:53:43.992 --> 00:53:45.952
Did you come to watch me fall apart?

00:53:46.953 --> 00:53:48.163
No.

00:53:48.246 --> 00:53:49.831
I came to ask you why.

00:53:52.375 --> 00:53:54.419
Why did you do that?

00:53:54.502 --> 00:53:55.712
I wanted to hear it from you.

00:53:56.838 --> 00:53:58.381
And you think I owe you an answer?

00:54:00.216 --> 00:54:03.053
Fine. I'll answer it.

00:54:07.891 --> 00:54:09.350
You want to know why?

00:54:14.939 --> 00:54:15.899
Because of you.

00:54:18.443 --> 00:54:20.236
All of this…

00:54:20.945 --> 00:54:22.363
is because of you.

00:54:25.158 --> 00:54:27.827
I didn't go abroad after we broke up.

00:54:30.163 --> 00:54:31.831
I was in a hospital.

00:54:33.458 --> 00:54:34.667
<i>A psych ward.</i>

00:54:37.504 --> 00:54:40.381
<i>I tried to take my life more than once</i>
<i>after we broke up.</i>

00:54:52.852 --> 00:54:54.104
<i>But…</i>

00:54:58.316 --> 00:54:59.734
<i>you were smiling.</i>

00:55:02.403 --> 00:55:04.447
<i>So brightly.</i>

00:55:07.784 --> 00:55:09.077
I just…

00:55:11.287 --> 00:55:13.623
wanted you back.

00:55:15.458 --> 00:55:20.338
If you hadn't pushed me away so coldly,
I never would've gone to that house.

00:55:20.421 --> 00:55:22.090
And if Kang Woo-seong…

00:55:22.757 --> 00:55:26.386
hadn't made such a big deal out of it,
none of this would've happened.

00:55:28.721 --> 00:55:30.056
This is all because of you.

00:55:32.517 --> 00:55:34.936
I hope you never forget me.

00:55:37.021 --> 00:55:39.649
I hope you dream of me every night

00:55:40.525 --> 00:55:42.485
and can't sleep.

00:55:43.319 --> 00:55:46.197
I want you to hate me

00:55:47.532 --> 00:55:48.741
and yourself…

00:55:49.534 --> 00:55:50.910
forever.

00:55:53.788 --> 00:55:55.081
No.

00:55:56.374 --> 00:55:59.210
I won't waste my time hating you.

00:56:01.337 --> 00:56:05.091
There's one thing
I could never wrap my head around.

00:56:07.468 --> 00:56:09.804
Why did you take that knife?

00:56:11.472 --> 00:56:14.100
If you'd just left it there,

00:56:14.184 --> 00:56:16.227
I would've taken the fall.

00:56:16.811 --> 00:56:18.605
It would have ended clean and easy.

00:56:19.814 --> 00:56:21.399
So why didn't you?

00:56:22.650 --> 00:56:26.154
If you want to say you did it
because you loved me,

00:56:28.531 --> 00:56:30.742
I want to tell you you're wrong.

00:56:32.827 --> 00:56:34.245
That's why I came here.

00:56:35.038 --> 00:56:36.664
That wasn't love.

00:56:40.043 --> 00:56:41.544
<i>Real love is</i>

00:56:42.503 --> 00:56:46.507
<i>cheering someone on</i>
<i>no matter where they are</i>

00:56:47.342 --> 00:56:49.802
<i>or who they become. Believing in them.</i>

00:56:50.386 --> 00:56:52.513
<i>Wishing them well with your whole heart.</i>

00:56:54.057 --> 00:56:55.475
<i>Wanting their happiness.</i>

00:57:36.307 --> 00:57:38.226
{\an8}ONE YEAR LATER

00:57:48.611 --> 00:57:50.238
No, no.

00:57:53.199 --> 00:57:56.703
<i>To meet the Gold Boys,</i>
<i>who are too busy with their world tour,</i>

00:57:56.786 --> 00:57:59.038
<i>I've flown all the way to New York.</i>

00:57:59.122 --> 00:58:01.124
<i>Gold Boys, it's great to see you!</i>

00:58:01.958 --> 00:58:04.544
<i>- Two, three.</i>
<i>- Hello, we're Gold Boys.</i>

00:58:06.462 --> 00:58:08.172
First of all, congratulations.

00:58:08.756 --> 00:58:12.552
I heard every show on your world tour
has completely sold out,

00:58:12.635 --> 00:58:14.345
and thanks to the overwhelming response,

00:58:14.429 --> 00:58:17.473
the tour has even been extended.

00:58:17.557 --> 00:58:21.144
Before we dive in, could you say
a few words to your Korean fans, Goldy,

00:58:21.227 --> 00:58:23.563
<i>who've been eagerly waiting for Gold Boys?</i>

00:58:24.147 --> 00:58:25.523
<i>Everyone.</i>

00:58:25.607 --> 00:58:27.233
{\an8}<i>I hope you're all doing well.</i>

00:58:27.817 --> 00:58:31.112
{\an8}<i>Even when we're not there, I believe</i>
<i>you'll take good care of yourselves.</i>

00:58:32.614 --> 00:58:36.326
<i>We're working hard so we can come back</i>
<i>to you as soon as possible.</i>

00:58:36.409 --> 00:58:38.786
So until then, make sure you eat well,

00:58:39.579 --> 00:58:40.872
don't get sick,

00:58:43.249 --> 00:58:45.293
<i>and stay healthy.</i>

00:59:35.927 --> 00:59:38.680
{\an8}<i>I'm sorry I can't be there with you.</i>

00:59:38.763 --> 00:59:40.264
{\an8}I miss you.

00:59:40.348 --> 00:59:43.142
{\an8}<i>I like La-ik on stage too.</i>

00:59:44.435 --> 00:59:47.438
{\an8}<i>I thought I had no choice</i>
<i>but to not back down then.</i>

00:59:47.522 --> 00:59:51.150
{\an8}That's why we won,
because we caught the real culprit.

00:59:52.360 --> 00:59:54.153
{\an8}<i>Lies can't beat the truth.</i>

00:59:54.237 --> 00:59:58.533
{\an8}As the bereaved family of Maeng Ji-yong,
I earnestly request

00:59:59.158 --> 01:00:00.910
{\an8}<i>that you order a retrial.</i>

01:00:01.619 --> 01:00:06.624
