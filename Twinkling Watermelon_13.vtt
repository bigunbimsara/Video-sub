(Episode 13)

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:09.840
Hey, we're here.

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.509
I'm sorry, but could you make a lap around the house?

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:18.850
Sure. Let's do that.

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:28.390
I don't care who you are.

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:31.960
I don't care if you're a middle-aged woman.

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:36.160
I don't care if you turn out to be a zombie.

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.529
That's why we should...

00:01:42.839 --> 00:01:43.970
stay together.

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:55.580
What do you say?

00:01:59.449 --> 00:02:00.550
I'm hungry.

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:04.559
What? Then why don't we go somewhere and have something to eat?

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:05.990
I'm tired.

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.229
I want to rest.

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:11.600
Could you help me get home?

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:17.910
Hey, what next?

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:22.209
Sir. I'm so sorry. Could you make one last lap around the house?

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:23.409
That's enough.

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:25.909
Do you have a lot of money?

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.759
Sir, could you open up the trunk?

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.119
- Sure. - Okay.

00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:37.619
Here.

00:02:50.439 --> 00:02:51.469
What's this?

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:54.540
I think I just saw something that didn't make any sense at all.

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.309
What's wrong?

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:59.849
- Nothing. - Okay.

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:04.420
Thank you.

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:10.420
Hey.

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:12.929
Do you want to have ramyeon before you go?

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:16.129
What?

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:23.799
Can you start boiling the water for ramyeon?

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:24.968
Let me take care of the luggage first.

00:03:24.969 --> 00:03:25.969
The kitchen is that way.

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:27.740
Shouldn't I say hello to your parents first?

00:03:28.839 --> 00:03:29.839
They're not here.

00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:31.879
- Both of them? - Yes.

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:33.748
I flew back to Korea from the US alone.

00:03:33.749 --> 00:03:35.820
Then you've been staying here on your own the whole time?

00:03:36.679 --> 00:03:38.089
At this rate, you might be too shocked to talk.

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:41.219
Then does it mean it's just you and me in this house?

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:45.129
Right?

00:03:47.929 --> 00:03:49.129
- I'll put this away. - I'll boil the water.

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:53.570
Oh, no.

00:04:01.779 --> 00:04:02.809
What's wrong?

00:04:05.649 --> 00:04:06.679
What's that?

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.920
I think I just saw something that didn't make any sense again.

00:04:17.689 --> 00:04:18.730
Nothing's wrong.

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:21.498
Okay. I'll carry this up for you.

00:04:21.499 --> 00:04:24.199
Okay. Thank you so much. It's the 1st door on the 2nd floor.

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:25.869
- Okay. - Okay.

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:34.440
Gosh, that scared me.

00:04:47.349 --> 00:04:49.089
(Who is the bandsman Mom loved?)

00:04:52.029 --> 00:04:54.659

(Alprazolam)

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:16.880
Hey, be careful! Gosh. Please be careful.

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:29.359
What did you put in the egg? Why did it catch fire like this?

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:32.130
Why are you so angry about that?

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:33.570
You're scarier than the fire.

00:05:33.799 --> 00:05:36.570
You live alone. Yet, you can't even cook a simple dish.

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:38.939
What have you been eating all this time?

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:41.978
How could you start such a big fire over just one egg?

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:43.409
Come on. Don't be like that.

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:47.380
You should be more careful next time.

00:05:47.549 --> 00:05:48.620
Did you get hurt?

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:02.159
It sounds so nice.

00:06:03.099 --> 00:06:04.099
Did you know?

00:06:04.899 --> 00:06:08.338
People suddenly crave pancakes on rainy days because...

00:06:08.339 --> 00:06:10.369
the sound of the rain falling and the sizzling pancakes...

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:11.370
sound similar.

00:06:11.539 --> 00:06:13.140
Yes. So I have heard.

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:19.310
My mother used to cook me pancakes often on rainy days.

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:23.180
Was it like that with your family too?

00:06:23.419 --> 00:06:25.489
- No. - What? Why not?

00:06:25.649 --> 00:06:27.489
Having pancakes on rainy days is like a national law.

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:31.190
I was the only one in my family who could hear the rain falling.

00:06:35.859 --> 00:06:37.159
It's ready.

00:06:38.299 --> 00:06:39.299
Okay.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.500
Gosh, it looks so good!

00:06:41.669 --> 00:06:42.770
Thank you for the food.

00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:52.880
Hey, this is so good. It's so crispy.

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:57.120
Don't tell me you were trying to go to the US to get some pancakes.

00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:58.520
No way.

00:07:01.659 --> 00:07:04.859
But why did you suddenly want to leave for the US?

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:10.000
Because I found out that my mother's first love was my dad.

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:14.000
- Hey... - No.

00:07:14.469 --> 00:07:16.898
Don't ask me. I won't tell you anything.

00:07:16.899 --> 00:07:18.469
This is all you're getting from me today.

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:23.380
I'm going to eat all the outer parts.

00:07:23.409 --> 00:07:24.978
Hey, can you slow down?

00:07:24.979 --> 00:07:26.809
- You might upset your stomach. - It's amazing. These are the best.

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:28.520
Come on. Tear a big piece for yourself.

00:07:30.219 --> 00:07:31.749
I told you I wanted all the outer parts.

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:33.689
Hey, that's the tastiest part.

00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:36.190
Come on. Let me have some too. I haven't had a meal today.

00:07:36.489 --> 00:07:38.488
- I'm hungry. Let me have some too. - Hey.

00:07:38.489 --> 00:07:39.589
Come on.

00:07:40.089 --> 00:07:41.728
- Let me have some too. - Here.

00:07:41.729 --> 00:07:43.629
- You'll get indigestion. Slow down. - I won't give it to you.

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:45.570
I want some of that too. Come on, let me have some!

00:07:46.099 --> 00:07:47.229
Give it to me.

00:07:47.729 --> 00:07:48.870
No. Wait.

00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:53.409
Are you a CODA?

00:07:56.339 --> 00:07:57.640
How did you know that?

00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:00.849
You're the only one in your family who can hear the rain falling.

00:08:01.349 --> 00:08:02.979
That's the word used to describe people like you.

00:08:03.549 --> 00:08:06.649
No. That's not what I meant. How did you know the term, "CODA?"

00:08:07.989 --> 00:08:10.459
Did that term not exist in 1995 yet?

00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:11.690
Oh, that?

00:08:12.089 --> 00:08:14.589
When I was in the US, I learned that from my deaf friend.

00:08:16.229 --> 00:08:17.260
I see.

00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:19.870
Ask me.

00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:21.870
Ask you what?

00:08:22.599 --> 00:08:25.140
- You don't have any questions? - Should I have questions?

00:08:26.909 --> 00:08:28.010
That's odd.

00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:30.408
When people find out that I'm a CODA,

00:08:30.409 --> 00:08:32.479
they usually ask me a lot of questions.

00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:35.149
At first, it starts off as curiosity.

00:08:35.649 --> 00:08:37.419
Then it turns into compassion.

00:08:38.049 --> 00:08:40.589
Afterward, it becomes pity which turns into kindness.

00:08:40.849 --> 00:08:42.589
In the end, they worry and show concern.

00:08:43.219 --> 00:08:45.560
That's just to name a few. I get all kinds of looks from them.

00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:48.728
That's because people with questions...

00:08:48.729 --> 00:08:51.400
want to hear that you're miserable.

00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:55.200
That way, it will be proof that they are happy.

00:08:56.599 --> 00:08:59.070
Gosh. What a way to kill my love for mankind.

00:08:59.869 --> 00:09:01.609
That's how people are.

00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:03.338
They want to offer sympathy,

00:09:03.339 --> 00:09:04.910
instead of being on the receiving end of it.

00:09:06.109 --> 00:09:07.509
Don't worry about them.

00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:09.118
Let me give you an example.

00:09:09.119 --> 00:09:11.449
Let's say you're super psyched about finding an interesting video.

00:09:11.450 --> 00:09:13.988
But when you start to watch it, it's not what you wanted.

00:09:13.989 --> 00:09:15.089
Then you would stop the video.

00:09:15.719 --> 00:09:17.320
That's sort of what they're doing.

00:09:23.930 --> 00:09:24.999
You should go home now.

00:09:25.369 --> 00:09:26.769
Thank you for everything today.

00:09:27.469 --> 00:09:29.598
Are you sure you can be alone here? You're not scared?

00:09:29.599 --> 00:09:31.809
What? If I tell you I'm scared to be alone,

00:09:31.810 --> 00:09:33.138
are you going to stay with me all night?

00:09:33.139 --> 00:09:34.769
What? All night?

00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:36.709
That's not what I meant.

00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:38.040
Look at you.

00:09:38.479 --> 00:09:40.709
You're already possessed by lust!

00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:42.219
You're a lustful evil.

00:09:43.979 --> 00:09:45.050
What?

00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:54.190
Gosh.

00:09:55.499 --> 00:09:56.499
What?

00:10:00.629 --> 00:10:01.839
You said I was a lustful evil.

00:10:04.969 --> 00:10:06.009
Are you sure?

00:10:07.139 --> 00:10:08.440
Am I sure I'm a lustful evil?

00:10:09.109 --> 00:10:10.139
Not that.

00:10:10.609 --> 00:10:12.810
Are you sure you can help me find my way back?

00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:14.249
What?

00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:16.180
I see.

00:10:17.119 --> 00:10:18.119
Yes.

00:10:19.589 --> 00:10:20.950
It will be hard.

00:10:20.989 --> 00:10:22.019
I know.

00:10:22.859 --> 00:10:24.929
I'm serious. It won't be that simple.

00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:26.089
I know that too.

00:10:28.599 --> 00:10:30.160
- You do? - Yes.

00:10:30.999 --> 00:10:33.969
You weren't just referring to a mere way to go back to the US.

00:10:34.570 --> 00:10:37.700
You're looking for a way to get to someone in the US.

00:10:38.839 --> 00:10:39.940
I'll help you find that person.

00:10:41.469 --> 00:10:44.639
Once I go back, I'll never be able to come back.

00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:47.280
That's why, if possible,

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:49.849
I'll take my sweet time to help you.

00:10:51.950 --> 00:10:53.489
I'll do my best to find a way,

00:10:54.190 --> 00:10:55.589
but I will slow it down as much as possible.

00:10:56.359 --> 00:10:57.359
That way,

00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:01.290
I'll get to spend more time with you.

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:12.609
Yes!

00:11:26.349 --> 00:11:27.889
I'll do my best to find a way,

00:11:28.489 --> 00:11:29.820
but I will slow it down as much as possible.

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:33.629
That way, I'll get to spend more time with you.

00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:57.950
What?

00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:27.180
(Restricted Caller ID)

00:12:27.749 --> 00:12:28.780
No way.

00:12:40.190 --> 00:12:42.300
- Hello. - Good evening.

00:12:42.830 --> 00:12:44.998
- Master? - Did you have a pleasant trip?

00:12:44.999 --> 00:12:47.170
Gosh, you startled me. Wait.

00:12:48.070 --> 00:12:49.639
Why are you asking me that in the past tense today?

00:12:49.999 --> 00:12:52.109
You're indeed quick at noticing these things.

00:12:52.570 --> 00:12:55.910
I think it's time to end the trip now.

00:12:56.310 --> 00:12:58.410
My trip is going to end?

00:12:59.710 --> 00:13:00.710
Then...

00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:04.080
does it mean I'll go back to 2023?

00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:05.550
Bingo.

00:13:06.589 --> 00:13:08.519
Soon, there will come a day with two moons in the sky.

00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:11.759
The door of time that connects the two worlds will open.

00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:15.660
That will be the only day you'll be allowed to go back.

00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:17.060
When will that be?

00:13:18.599 --> 00:13:19.969
To make sure you don't get lost,

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:23.499
I will keep the light on at La Vida Music.

00:13:23.839 --> 00:13:25.570
- Bye then. - Wait.

00:13:26.170 --> 00:13:27.710
When will there be two moons?

00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:29.109
As for that...

00:13:29.639 --> 00:13:30.710
Coming soon.

00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:33.550
Hello? Wait. Master!

00:14:17.759 --> 00:14:19.830
Soon, there will come a day with two moons in the sky.

00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:22.900
The door of time that connects the two worlds will open.

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:26.330
That will be the only day you'll be allowed to go back.

00:14:30.869 --> 00:14:31.869
Newspapers.

00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:33.138
(Snail Guesthouse)

00:14:33.139 --> 00:14:35.310
"My left hand is there solely for support."

00:14:37.139 --> 00:14:38.339
Goal!

00:14:39.950 --> 00:14:40.979
Darn it.

00:14:52.589 --> 00:14:53.960
The festival is over.

00:14:54.989 --> 00:14:56.499
Don't come to see me ever again.

00:14:57.330 --> 00:15:00.599
You and I live in different worlds, anyway.

00:15:11.979 --> 00:15:12.979
Se Gyeong.

00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:15.580
You're going to school early. Are you a model student now?

00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:17.419
I'm an old man now.

00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:19.619
I've been getting up early for no reason these days.

00:15:21.089 --> 00:15:22.089
Sorry.

00:15:22.989 --> 00:15:24.289
Did you wish that I would become an old man?

00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:27.329
No. I'm sorry I ran away at the festival without telling you.

00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:29.999
I see. Is that why you're here?

00:15:30.129 --> 00:15:31.160
Yes.

00:15:31.359 --> 00:15:33.069
I wanted to give you a sincere apology...

00:15:33.070 --> 00:15:34.400
and tell you the truth.

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:39.639
Yi Chan. The truth is...

00:15:39.869 --> 00:15:42.239
I know. You like Ha Eun Gyeol, right?

00:15:43.639 --> 00:15:44.780
How did you know?

00:16:14.310 --> 00:16:15.940
Do you think I'm blind?

00:16:17.009 --> 00:16:18.848
I don't know if you're going to believe me,

00:16:18.849 --> 00:16:22.050
but I had no intention of using or deceiving you.

00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:26.089
Actually, there's a secret I can't tell people.

00:16:27.150 --> 00:16:28.190
Thank you.

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:31.960
- That was random. - I know.

00:16:33.290 --> 00:16:35.759
Thanks to you, every day has been exciting like a festival.

00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:37.200
You made my heart flutter and I had fun.

00:16:37.629 --> 00:16:39.070
I gave my all to my youth.

00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:41.369
I also had a blast.

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:43.700
Although I lost the bet,

00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:46.440
thanks to you, I have a great story.

00:16:48.070 --> 00:16:49.609
Aren't you mad?

00:16:49.839 --> 00:16:50.879
No.

00:16:51.009 --> 00:16:53.410
Because you left, the festival became fun for everyone,

00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:54.979
not a show about love.

00:16:56.019 --> 00:16:57.550
You were perfect to the end.

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:03.560
What a bummer.

00:17:03.989 --> 00:17:05.530
I should have chosen you.

00:17:06.690 --> 00:17:07.729
It's too late now.

00:17:08.129 --> 00:17:09.699
Hey, you don't even seem a bit upset.

00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:11.830
Didn't you know? I'm a cold-hearted guy.

00:17:11.999 --> 00:17:13.228
Did you even like me?

00:17:13.229 --> 00:17:14.529
This is a story with an open ending... Oh, my.

00:17:14.530 --> 00:17:15.899
It's too soon for touching.

00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:17.540
I wasn't touching you. I was punching you.

00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:19.410
Let's leave it as a story with an open ending.

00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:37.190
(The début show of Watermelon Sugar)

00:17:40.729 --> 00:17:41.759
What are you doing?

00:17:42.430 --> 00:17:44.130
I'm trying to think of swear words for you.

00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:47.828
When will you move all the stuff in the practice room?

00:17:47.829 --> 00:17:49.539
The other guys have already pulled their stuff out.

00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:51.870
Talk about having loyal friends.

00:17:52.870 --> 00:17:54.009
What do you expect?

00:17:54.670 --> 00:17:57.509
It was just a temporary band we put together for the festival.

00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:00.910
Ha Yi Chan. Oh Ma Joo.

00:18:02.049 --> 00:18:03.620
The principal wants to see you guys.

00:18:04.249 --> 00:18:06.350
Did you guys get into trouble again?

00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:08.489
Goodness.

00:18:13.989 --> 00:18:16.559
What is this? What are you guys doing here?

00:18:16.799 --> 00:18:19.400
What is this? I have a bad feeling about this.

00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:20.769
Why...

00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:22.199
No way.

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:24.840
Did they find out about our fight with Jindo Dog Gang?

00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:31.008
Is everyone here?

00:18:31.009 --> 00:18:32.049
Yes, sir!

00:18:33.549 --> 00:18:35.478
Sit down.

00:18:35.479 --> 00:18:37.650
- Sit down. - Okay.

00:18:40.789 --> 00:18:42.090
So...

00:18:42.259 --> 00:18:43.890
according to what I heard,

00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:48.090
you guys completely destroyed the stage at the festival.

00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:55.440
There's one more guy, right?

00:18:56.670 --> 00:18:59.039
The one who goes to Seowon Arts High School.

00:19:00.009 --> 00:19:01.969
What was his name?

00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:04.109
- It's our fault. - It's our fault.

00:19:04.110 --> 00:19:05.578
I committed a grave sin.

00:19:05.579 --> 00:19:08.350
No, you didn't.

00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:13.950
I think I can deal with the student who goes to a different school.

00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:19.630
Come on.

00:19:21.029 --> 00:19:22.729
(Baekwang High School)

00:19:26.299 --> 00:19:27.630
You guys, sign here first.

00:19:28.269 --> 00:19:29.998
(No! I can't drop out of school! I'll be a better person!)

00:19:29.999 --> 00:19:31.440
(I need a high school diploma to inherit Ma Joo's Fabrics.)

00:19:31.769 --> 00:19:33.239
- Please. - No.

00:19:34.509 --> 00:19:35.639
It's an emergency.

00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:37.139
We're in dire danger.

00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:38.879
When the class... No, when you're done with cleaning,

00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:40.410
come to the practice room immediately.

00:19:43.719 --> 00:19:45.120
What's the matter?

00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:46.950
What happened?

00:19:51.059 --> 00:19:52.329
(Application for the 6th National Teen Band Contest)

00:19:52.590 --> 00:19:53.629
What's that?

00:19:53.630 --> 00:19:57.200
It's an application form for the National Teen Band Contest.

00:20:02.539 --> 00:20:06.410
Men need a big stage.

00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:08.640
Sign the application.

00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:10.979
Enter the contest.

00:20:11.579 --> 00:20:13.979
And kill the stage.

00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:18.789
- Oh, my gosh. - But,

00:20:21.789 --> 00:20:25.190
no matter what it takes,

00:20:25.390 --> 00:20:28.559
you should beat Ilyoung High school.

00:20:31.329 --> 00:20:32.869
Is Ilyoung High School that great?

00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:36.069
The principal of Ilyoung High School is our principal's home boy.

00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:37.940
And he's his arch enemy.

00:20:39.469 --> 00:20:40.869
Because they always fight over the number of students...

00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:42.309
accepted to Seoul National University.

00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:43.779
And we lose all the time.

00:20:45.809 --> 00:20:48.779
Their school band is good as well.

00:20:49.950 --> 00:20:51.680
He said we should beat Ilyoung.

00:20:51.749 --> 00:20:53.619
It means we should win the contest.

00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:55.718
Let's do it then. It's not impossible.

00:20:55.719 --> 00:20:57.420
He looked like Yi Chan's son just now.

00:20:57.989 --> 00:20:59.729
The problem isn't just their talent.

00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:01.090
You've written some songs, right?

00:21:04.799 --> 00:21:06.798
Have you not?

00:21:06.799 --> 00:21:08.768
Well...

00:21:08.769 --> 00:21:11.140
We mostly do covers.

00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:13.008
So we haven't written anything yet.

00:21:13.009 --> 00:21:14.069
What?

00:21:15.069 --> 00:21:17.380
What are you going to do then?

00:21:18.079 --> 00:21:20.909
You must have your own song...

00:21:20.910 --> 00:21:22.819
to participate in the contest.

00:21:23.279 --> 00:21:26.450
What are you going to do now?

00:21:26.989 --> 00:21:28.319
What have you been doing?

00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:32.190
They wrote so many songs.

00:21:32.789 --> 00:21:33.859
And you guys...

00:21:33.860 --> 00:21:35.829
- We'll make one. - We'll make one.

00:21:36.529 --> 00:21:37.529
What?

00:21:37.529 --> 00:21:38.529
This is what happened.

00:21:38.530 --> 00:21:40.869
We can make one. What's the problem?

00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:42.798
He must be Yi Chan's son.

00:21:42.799 --> 00:21:43.870
My son is right.

00:21:46.269 --> 00:21:48.340
Let's write our own song.

00:21:52.009 --> 00:21:53.749
Yi Chan, you must've bought a vending machine.

00:21:53.950 --> 00:21:57.049
You just put coins in the machine, and a song comes out like magic.

00:21:57.319 --> 00:22:00.988
We're as dumb as rocks. How can we write a song in a month?

00:22:00.989 --> 00:22:02.049
We did it.

00:22:02.789 --> 00:22:05.019
We practiced just for a month for the festival.

00:22:05.559 --> 00:22:06.559
Do you not remember?

00:22:07.529 --> 00:22:09.759
Close your eyes and think about it.

00:22:12.029 --> 00:22:14.630
The blood, sweat, and tears we shed.

00:22:16.170 --> 00:22:18.140
The hot breath.

00:22:20.170 --> 00:22:21.239
As a result,

00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:25.650
we received thrilling heat and cheers.

00:22:25.910 --> 00:22:30.279
The great attention and love from our female fans.

00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:36.890
Don't you want to feel it again?

00:22:37.489 --> 00:22:39.489
Not with covers, but with our own song.

00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:40.660
Yes.

00:22:40.661 --> 00:22:41.759
I guess.

00:22:42.229 --> 00:22:43.360
In that sense,

00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:47.328
how about going to a song camp next weekend?

00:22:47.329 --> 00:22:48.469
- A song camp? - A song camp?

00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:51.099
Let's go and decide on the theme of the song.

00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:54.238
To celebrate the revival of Watermelon Sugar,

00:22:54.239 --> 00:22:55.369
let's encourage teamwork.

00:22:55.370 --> 00:22:57.180
How about that? What do you say?

00:22:57.279 --> 00:22:58.409
I think it sounds good.

00:22:58.410 --> 00:23:00.180
- I like it too. - Yes. Let's go.

00:23:00.479 --> 00:23:01.710
Yes. Let's go.

00:23:02.319 --> 00:23:03.548
We're dumb,

00:23:03.549 --> 00:23:05.578
but we will make something if we work together. Don't you think so?

00:23:05.579 --> 00:23:07.218
Okay. Manager.

00:23:07.219 --> 00:23:09.589
Find an accommodation and train tickets right away.

00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:10.660
Yes, sir.

00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:13.590
Train tickets and accommodation.

00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:20.029
But we should tell Se Gyeong and Chung Ah too, right?

00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:23.669
We need a hairstylist, makeup artist, stylist,

00:23:23.670 --> 00:23:25.599
and photographer for the big stage.

00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:28.738
Which of you will tell them?

00:23:28.739 --> 00:23:30.140
Eun Gyeol will do it.

00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:32.140
The meeting is over.

00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:34.508
Let's go have tteokbokki. It's on me.

00:23:34.509 --> 00:23:36.748
Ma Joo, please bring my bag.

00:23:36.749 --> 00:23:37.879
- He... - He just left.

00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:38.988
Are you not going to argue?

00:23:38.989 --> 00:23:41.190
- Why are you guys not arguing? - Why are you not arguing?

00:23:42.759 --> 00:23:43.788
It's weird.

00:23:43.789 --> 00:23:45.729
Why are they not arguing? That's odd.

00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:53.429
- We can do it. - As long as you concentrate.

00:23:53.430 --> 00:23:55.869
- Okay? We're Watermelon. - As long as you do your job.

00:23:55.870 --> 00:23:56.899
Sugar.

00:23:56.900 --> 00:23:58.870
- Watermelon. - Sugar.

00:23:59.170 --> 00:24:00.968
- Go. - Wait.

00:24:00.969 --> 00:24:01.969
Let's go.

00:24:01.970 --> 00:24:04.180
I have something to say.

00:24:05.479 --> 00:24:09.018
Well, actually, I...

00:24:09.019 --> 00:24:11.619
Should I become a priest?

00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:13.819
Why does everyone want to confess their sins to me?

00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:16.289
You're late, you punk.

00:24:16.890 --> 00:24:19.159
Se Gyeong told me everything in the morning.

00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:22.558
What? What did she say?

00:24:22.559 --> 00:24:23.759
She said she liked you.

00:24:25.130 --> 00:24:26.998
It must be nice to have a good look.

00:24:26.999 --> 00:24:28.100
Hey.

00:24:29.569 --> 00:24:30.639
Are you okay with that?

00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:33.008
Would you be okay if you were me?

00:24:33.009 --> 00:24:34.709
Just punch me then.

00:24:34.710 --> 00:24:36.009
I was going to do it.

00:24:41.450 --> 00:24:43.049
You should treat her well.

00:24:43.549 --> 00:24:44.680
I'll be watching you.

00:24:45.850 --> 00:24:48.048
If you make her cry,

00:24:48.049 --> 00:24:49.789
you're going to bleed from your eyes.

00:24:50.059 --> 00:24:51.319
All right.

00:24:51.420 --> 00:24:53.558
We're still friends then, right?

00:24:53.559 --> 00:24:55.529
Stay out of my sight for a while.

00:24:56.460 --> 00:24:57.529
Until when?

00:24:58.100 --> 00:24:59.100
After three minutes.

00:25:04.069 --> 00:25:07.569
My 18-year-old dad is much cooler than I thought.

00:25:15.249 --> 00:25:17.779
Why? Let's go together.

00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:20.920
Is it...

00:25:21.850 --> 00:25:23.219
because of Yi Chan?

00:25:25.289 --> 00:25:26.329
No, it's not.

00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:28.930
I'm busy preparing for the exhibition.

00:25:30.729 --> 00:25:32.029
I told you.

00:25:32.329 --> 00:25:35.900
Se Gyeong didn't choose anyone at the festival.

00:25:38.170 --> 00:25:39.840
It's your chance.

00:25:40.170 --> 00:25:41.410
So come with us.

00:25:43.279 --> 00:25:46.109
I know you've been trying your best...

00:25:46.110 --> 00:25:47.710
to make things work for Yi Chan and me.

00:25:48.249 --> 00:25:50.880
But I'll take care of it myself from now on.

00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:53.919
Don't be like this. Let's go to the song camp.

00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:55.090
I'll help you.

00:25:56.690 --> 00:25:57.690
It's my life.

00:25:58.759 --> 00:25:59.890
Not yours.

00:26:01.529 --> 00:26:03.799
I can do it by myself. Do you not trust me?

00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:10.539
Let's now learn sign language then.

00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:22.479
My 18-year-old mom is becoming stronger.

00:26:24.279 --> 00:26:26.620
Chung Ah, let's go to the song camp.

00:26:26.719 --> 00:26:28.549
You couldn't watch the festival.

00:26:28.890 --> 00:26:31.019
You must come. I'll be waiting.

00:26:33.259 --> 00:26:35.130
(Chung Ah, let's go to the song camp.)

00:26:43.469 --> 00:26:44.769
(You couldn't watch the festival. You must come. I'll be waiting.)

00:26:46.009 --> 00:26:47.370
No.

00:26:50.309 --> 00:26:51.340
Gosh.

00:27:11.029 --> 00:27:13.569
The band I thought was going to disband revived.

00:27:15.999 --> 00:27:18.499
Everything is going well, but I...

00:27:22.069 --> 00:27:25.710
I think it's time to end the trip now.

00:27:44.299 --> 00:27:45.360
What are you doing here?

00:27:47.769 --> 00:27:48.900
Well...

00:27:49.539 --> 00:27:51.238
My teacher kept telling me...

00:27:51.239 --> 00:27:52.910
to play the cello in front of the whole class.

00:27:53.710 --> 00:27:56.140
Everything seems to be going well, but I...

00:27:56.479 --> 00:27:59.680
I told him I didn't want to do it and that I'd rather die.

00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:01.880
For some strange reason, I keep...

00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:04.180
So I'm playing hooky now.

00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:05.950
Pretend you didn't see me.

00:28:06.390 --> 00:28:09.620
I keep wanting to stay here just a little longer.

00:28:12.259 --> 00:28:13.289
Let's go.

00:28:16.029 --> 00:28:17.930
No, I'm not going back in there.

00:28:18.329 --> 00:28:19.629
Don't you know what "playing hooky" means?

00:28:19.630 --> 00:28:21.069
I never told you to go back to your class.

00:28:22.799 --> 00:28:23.999
Let's run away together.

00:28:27.370 --> 00:28:28.569
It's not time yet.

00:28:32.479 --> 00:28:33.650
Not today.

00:28:43.390 --> 00:28:44.460
Right now,

00:28:45.289 --> 00:28:46.590
we can be together.

00:29:00.610 --> 00:29:02.210
Be honest with me.

00:29:02.569 --> 00:29:03.639
About what?

00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:05.679
You said you were smitten with me at first sight.

00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:07.180
That was a lie, right?

00:29:07.450 --> 00:29:08.479
What?

00:29:09.049 --> 00:29:10.180
I'll give you three seconds.

00:29:10.479 --> 00:29:12.649
You have three seconds to tell me when you started falling for me...

00:29:12.650 --> 00:29:14.649
and why you like me. One!

00:29:14.650 --> 00:29:16.489
When you came back from the US.

00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:18.389
What?

00:29:18.390 --> 00:29:21.029
The day I ran into you when you were working in Hongdae.

00:29:21.989 --> 00:29:23.460
I liked that you were honest.

00:29:23.729 --> 00:29:25.199
I wouldn't say it was love at first sight.

00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:26.569
I fell for you while bickering with you.

00:29:29.130 --> 00:29:31.670
- Why? What is it? - That's really me!

00:29:31.870 --> 00:29:33.640
I'm serious!

00:29:33.769 --> 00:29:34.809
What?

00:29:43.579 --> 00:29:44.749
(Tteokbokki, Sundae, Fritters, Dumplings)

00:29:44.850 --> 00:29:47.249
I said, no! I'm not going.

00:29:47.390 --> 00:29:48.489
Let go, will you?

00:29:49.390 --> 00:29:50.719
Are you really going to be like this?

00:29:51.890 --> 00:29:52.890
Yi Chan.

00:29:52.891 --> 00:29:55.529
Does the band need a designer or not?

00:29:55.590 --> 00:29:57.029
You said she had already declined.

00:29:57.130 --> 00:29:58.798
And she doesn't want to go to the song camp.

00:29:58.799 --> 00:30:01.129
Right, so let's persuade her in person!

00:30:01.130 --> 00:30:03.170
Why bother persuading her when she doesn't want to go?

00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:04.700
And that girl, Yoon Chung Ah...

00:30:06.539 --> 00:30:08.840
- She won't listen to me. - What?

00:30:09.610 --> 00:30:11.009
Get Eun Gyeol to talk to her!

00:30:11.610 --> 00:30:15.049
Hey, stop! Eun Gyeol rarely sees her these days.

00:30:15.809 --> 00:30:17.649
And because of the exhibition, she’s been practically...

00:30:17.650 --> 00:30:19.788
- living at the academy! - Hey, let go!

00:30:19.789 --> 00:30:21.449
Let's go and persuade her since we need her!

00:30:21.450 --> 00:30:23.759
If you want to persuade her, do it yourself!

00:30:24.719 --> 00:30:25.759
Okay.

00:30:26.059 --> 00:30:28.559
I'll do the talking, so just be my interpreter.

00:30:29.029 --> 00:30:31.028
- Let go. - I don't know sign language!

00:30:31.029 --> 00:30:32.429
I don't know either.

00:30:32.430 --> 00:30:34.729
- I've just started to learn... - Oh, here it is!

00:30:38.140 --> 00:30:39.670
My pager. Someone's paging me.

00:30:40.110 --> 00:30:42.910
Hey, I'll go check this message quickly. Wait right here.

00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:44.610
Seriously, stay put.

00:30:45.910 --> 00:30:47.180
You know I won't stay put.

00:30:55.890 --> 00:30:56.890
Oh, right.

00:31:00.860 --> 00:31:02.090
Hey, get out of my way!

00:31:04.259 --> 00:31:06.569
Sorry, sir. She'll be out of your way in no time.

00:31:06.670 --> 00:31:09.600
The difference would be like a split second, you know?

00:31:14.170 --> 00:31:16.380
Thank you. Have a nice day! Thank you again!

00:31:31.559 --> 00:31:32.890
Hi, friend.

00:31:33.529 --> 00:31:34.690
Have you been well?

00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:16.568
Hey, the teacher said to go and eat something now.

00:32:16.569 --> 00:32:18.440
The interim evaluation will begin in an hour.

00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:21.309
- Shoot. I hate the evaluation. - Come on. Let's go.

00:32:22.170 --> 00:32:23.879
Gosh, I'm tired.

00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:25.779
- Hey, come on. - Yes, I'm coming.

00:32:52.910 --> 00:32:53.910
Drink up.

00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:55.969
You must be thirsty.

00:32:57.680 --> 00:32:59.109
You don't need to be so guarded.

00:32:59.110 --> 00:33:01.549
There's no poison in it, so relax and...

00:33:03.749 --> 00:33:05.349
Hey, wait!

00:33:05.350 --> 00:33:06.749
Wait, hey!

00:33:07.489 --> 00:33:10.360
Hey, where are you going? Hey!

00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:12.789
She can't understand what you're saying.

00:33:13.259 --> 00:33:14.289
Sorry?

00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:17.930
Hey, wait.

00:33:19.130 --> 00:33:20.870
You go to the art academy over there, don't you?

00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:24.039
I also attend an academy in the area, so I see you often.

00:33:24.900 --> 00:33:27.140
I go to Dongwon High School. I'm in 11th grade.

00:33:27.769 --> 00:33:29.709
You must be an art major at Seowon Arts High School.

00:33:29.710 --> 00:33:30.979
Wait, one moment.

00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:32.949
If you're free now,

00:33:32.950 --> 00:33:34.749
how about we talk at a quiet café somewhere?

00:33:35.049 --> 00:33:36.180
I'll buy you a parfait.

00:33:37.249 --> 00:33:38.279
To tell you the truth,

00:33:39.180 --> 00:33:41.090
you're so my type.

00:33:45.460 --> 00:33:46.460
Hey!

00:33:47.759 --> 00:33:49.289
Hey, do you take me as a joke?

00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:50.998
Why do you keep ignoring me?

00:33:50.999 --> 00:33:52.728
If you don't like me, just say so.

00:33:52.729 --> 00:33:55.600
Hey, why are you flat out ignoring me?

00:33:56.940 --> 00:33:58.569
- You little... - Hey, don't.

00:33:58.969 --> 00:34:00.939
- She can't speak. - What?

00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:02.469
She's deaf.

00:34:07.009 --> 00:34:09.009
What? She really can't hear anything?

00:34:11.350 --> 00:34:13.350
Is this real? Or is she just faking it?

00:34:15.289 --> 00:34:16.718
- Come here. - Who are you?

00:34:16.719 --> 00:34:17.889
You too. Come here.

00:34:17.890 --> 00:34:19.359
- Hey, it hurts. - Ouch.

00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:21.690
- All right, come on. - Hey, it hurts.

00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:26.400
Darn it.

00:34:28.499 --> 00:34:29.599
Do you think you're little kids?

00:34:30.740 --> 00:34:32.400
Must you be so immature and childish?

00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:35.340
Open your diary now and write this down.

00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:39.710
"Dear Diary, a handsome guy taught me a lesson today."

00:34:40.409 --> 00:34:42.010
"It was very impressive."

00:34:42.780 --> 00:34:45.320
"He taught me that I was a real jerk."

00:34:46.490 --> 00:34:48.590
"From now on, I should work hard to be a better person."

00:34:50.159 --> 00:34:51.190
You won't write it down?

00:34:52.619 --> 00:34:53.829
You'd better not cross the line.

00:34:55.329 --> 00:34:56.800
I warned you nicely this time.

00:34:57.460 --> 00:34:59.530
Lay a finger on her again, and you're dead meat.

00:35:01.699 --> 00:35:02.729
Gosh.

00:35:06.539 --> 00:35:09.240
Hey. Why did you have to pick her, of all the girls?

00:35:09.909 --> 00:35:10.940
Hey, look.

00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:13.109
That deaf girl was wearing earphones.

00:35:13.110 --> 00:35:14.110
How was I supposed to know?

00:35:14.979 --> 00:35:17.019
That's true. How were you supposed to know?

00:35:20.650 --> 00:35:22.949
I told them not to cross the line. And here they are, moving the line.

00:35:26.829 --> 00:35:28.490
- No... - Hey!

00:35:50.650 --> 00:35:52.179
Drum rolls.

00:35:54.119 --> 00:35:55.249
Okay, let me try that one more time.

00:35:56.690 --> 00:35:58.119
(Dud)

00:36:00.460 --> 00:36:02.630
- Try it on. - Yes, I must.

00:36:02.829 --> 00:36:04.729
- It suits you. It's so pretty. - Does it?

00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:06.030
It looks good on me, right?

00:36:07.570 --> 00:36:08.570
Here, look.

00:36:10.470 --> 00:36:11.470
What is this?

00:36:12.340 --> 00:36:13.510
Here, princess.

00:36:14.740 --> 00:36:15.970
I'm the frog prince.

00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:17.940
I'm the princess.

00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:22.909
(Succeed and get one more.)

00:36:23.519 --> 00:36:25.019
You see, I'm very competitive.

00:36:25.420 --> 00:36:26.888
- Are you? - Yes.

00:36:26.889 --> 00:36:28.519
So am I.

00:36:29.590 --> 00:36:30.619
Hey, watch.

00:36:35.990 --> 00:36:36.999
Eat this.

00:36:37.460 --> 00:36:38.760
- It's good. - Yes, it's good.

00:36:39.729 --> 00:36:42.470
You have to keep smiling for 15 minutes.

00:36:42.599 --> 00:36:44.740
- Like this? For 15 minutes? - That's right.

00:36:46.039 --> 00:36:47.408
Are your eyebrows this thick?

00:36:47.409 --> 00:36:48.768
They're very thick. Look.

00:36:48.769 --> 00:36:50.639
My, you do have such thick eyebrows.

00:37:11.530 --> 00:37:12.699
(Alprazolam)

00:37:14.269 --> 00:37:16.170
I found this while moving your suitcase a while back...

00:37:16.570 --> 00:37:18.139
but missed my chance to give it back to you.

00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:23.479
Can I ask you why you need this?

00:37:27.349 --> 00:37:29.880
Does it have something to do with why you hate the cello so much?

00:37:32.749 --> 00:37:34.990
Or with why you ran away to the swimming pool?

00:37:37.990 --> 00:37:40.058
Is it connected to the reason you can't find a way to go back?

00:37:40.059 --> 00:37:42.090
My mom forced me to look happy,

00:37:42.389 --> 00:37:44.360
while I expressed with my whole body that I was miserable.

00:37:46.429 --> 00:37:48.170
We fought like a spear and shield.

00:37:49.130 --> 00:37:50.940
When I pulled myself together, I was in front of a psychiatrist.

00:37:51.940 --> 00:37:54.240
So I expressed how miserable I was after suppressing it for a while,

00:37:55.409 --> 00:37:56.679
and the psychiatrist gave me that.

00:37:57.710 --> 00:38:00.679
Ever since then, those pills and I have been best friends.

00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:03.949
Does it answer your question?

00:38:04.949 --> 00:38:06.889
What made you that miserable?

00:38:07.349 --> 00:38:08.889
You want me to talk all about it?

00:38:09.190 --> 00:38:10.490
In front of you?

00:38:10.889 --> 00:38:12.019
Gosh, forget it.

00:38:12.789 --> 00:38:15.829
If I tell you, I'll just sound like a spoiled girl.

00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:17.059
I'll sound like a baby.

00:38:17.460 --> 00:38:19.329
It'll do nothing but show you how fragile I am mentally.

00:38:23.970 --> 00:38:25.240
Shall I still tell you all about it?

00:38:26.539 --> 00:38:28.070
Shall we see which one of us is more miserable?

00:38:33.849 --> 00:38:36.010
Welcome. We heard you could play the cello pretty well too.

00:38:36.849 --> 00:38:38.448
I didn't want to argue with my mom,

00:38:38.449 --> 00:38:40.449
so I listened to her and came here.

00:38:41.889 --> 00:38:43.289
But what do you girls do here anyway?

00:38:44.789 --> 00:38:46.420
This is like a social club.

00:38:46.789 --> 00:38:47.828
You must know what it is.

00:38:47.829 --> 00:38:51.098
Successful people make social clubs like this to help each other...

00:38:51.099 --> 00:38:52.400
and build connections.

00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:54.928
So, you're like Barbies invited...

00:38:54.929 --> 00:38:56.670
to the connection-building club your moms created.

00:38:58.039 --> 00:38:59.369
Okay, so what do you normally do here?

00:38:59.499 --> 00:39:01.268
We bribe the judges at the competitions...

00:39:01.269 --> 00:39:02.470
and find out which songs will be on the exams.

00:39:02.809 --> 00:39:05.139
- What? - Oh, that's what our moms do.

00:39:05.740 --> 00:39:08.010
All we have to do is look pretty like dolls.

00:39:09.110 --> 00:39:10.179
Until when?

00:39:10.849 --> 00:39:12.449
Until we conquer the world?

00:39:13.889 --> 00:39:17.320
Our moms' vanity and ambition won't be satisfied until then.

00:39:19.490 --> 00:39:22.190
Oh, didn't your mom tell you to befriend me?

00:39:22.789 --> 00:39:25.530
Let's show her. Although, I'm just number one in the country now.

00:39:29.229 --> 00:39:31.670
Smile, like a pretty doll.

00:39:32.070 --> 00:39:33.409
We should make our moms happy.

00:39:36.340 --> 00:39:38.479
One, two, three.

00:39:54.059 --> 00:39:56.590
You must be devastated, but be mature about it and get over it.

00:39:57.630 --> 00:39:58.859
You don't want people to say you won...

00:39:58.860 --> 00:40:01.099
first place by default because of a friend who took her own life.

00:40:03.369 --> 00:40:05.070
Don't let your mind falter.

00:40:05.340 --> 00:40:08.539
But remember these emotions you're feeling now...

00:40:09.470 --> 00:40:12.579
so you can think of them when you're playing sad music later on.

00:40:22.550 --> 00:40:23.819
What's she doing?

00:40:23.820 --> 00:40:24.920
I can't hear it.

00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:27.559
I hear no sound.

00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:30.800
I can't hear anything!

00:40:34.229 --> 00:40:36.739
ENT specialists couldn't figure out what was wrong with me,

00:40:36.740 --> 00:40:38.699
so I became best friends with psychiatric medications.

00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:42.439
My mom, who wanted to be compensated for her failed life through me,

00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:43.639
became best friends with alcohol.

00:40:44.639 --> 00:40:46.240
It's such a cliché story.

00:40:46.749 --> 00:40:50.179
A pathetic story about a mentally fragile mother and daughter.

00:40:55.590 --> 00:40:56.650
Let's go.

00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:09.170
Hey. Be honest, okay?

00:41:09.599 --> 00:41:11.169
You guys stopped her.

00:41:11.170 --> 00:41:13.138
You provoked, threatened, and made fun of her!

00:41:13.139 --> 00:41:14.669
You got caught while extorting money from her,

00:41:14.670 --> 00:41:16.439
so you're trying to dump it all on us.

00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:18.179
- You little... - Quiet down, both of you!

00:41:21.179 --> 00:41:22.309
You still haven't finished writing it?

00:41:24.050 --> 00:41:26.280
Hey, you! If you keep this up, you and I will have a problem.

00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:28.549
You refused to call your parents...

00:41:28.550 --> 00:41:30.260
and don't want to write down what happened.

00:41:30.490 --> 00:41:32.320
What am I supposed to do if you're being so uncooperative?

00:41:33.530 --> 00:41:34.590
Sir.

00:41:35.190 --> 00:41:36.760
She can't gauge the situation.

00:41:37.159 --> 00:41:39.428
What can that deaf girl tell you when she can't hear a thing?

00:41:39.429 --> 00:41:42.300
Hey, you little... Do you have a death wish?

00:41:44.099 --> 00:41:46.170
Good for you that you're not deaf.

00:41:46.670 --> 00:41:48.609
What did you hear so well...

00:41:48.610 --> 00:41:50.440
that you're talking such trash?

00:41:51.179 --> 00:41:53.280
Hey, granny. Who are you to butt in?

00:41:55.349 --> 00:41:58.179
I'm this boy's grandmother.

00:41:59.019 --> 00:42:01.149
They say you should wrap this up and let him go...

00:42:01.150 --> 00:42:03.589
unless you want to put him behind bars.

00:42:03.590 --> 00:42:04.720
Says who?

00:42:05.220 --> 00:42:06.860
Kang Chang Sik.

00:42:06.990 --> 00:42:08.360
Who is Kang Chang Sik?

00:42:09.590 --> 00:42:11.199
(Warmhearted Trustworthy Police)

00:42:11.530 --> 00:42:12.599
You mean, my chief?

00:42:13.599 --> 00:42:14.699
Chang Sik...

00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:17.740
stayed at my guesthouse while studying to become a police officer.

00:42:17.900 --> 00:42:19.799
He had nothing and nowhere to stay.

00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:22.809
He was stick-skinny, so I fed him well.

00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:25.179
And this is how he's repaying me for my hospitality.

00:42:27.610 --> 00:42:30.780
Has he not called you yet to tell you to let him go?

00:42:31.179 --> 00:42:32.720
No, not yet.

00:42:32.979 --> 00:42:34.949
I can't let him go yet as their statements don't match up.

00:42:35.220 --> 00:42:36.960
And they'll be the ones getting released.

00:42:40.389 --> 00:42:42.888
But the lady at the shoe store saw what happened.

00:42:42.889 --> 00:42:43.929
What?

00:42:44.999 --> 00:42:47.900
I visited every single shop in that area...

00:42:48.130 --> 00:42:50.269
and managed to find a witness.

00:42:51.539 --> 00:42:54.569
No, let me explain. I just wanted to talk to her.

00:42:54.570 --> 00:42:56.110
Hey, be quiet!

00:42:56.340 --> 00:42:57.579
See? Now, it all matches up.

00:42:57.909 --> 00:42:59.139
Hurry up and let them go.

00:42:59.340 --> 00:43:02.079
It's well past their mealtime. They must be hungry.

00:43:04.550 --> 00:43:07.050
(Mapo Dohwa Patrol Division Station)

00:43:07.820 --> 00:43:08.849
Oh, boy.

00:43:21.470 --> 00:43:23.969
Since we met like this,

00:43:23.970 --> 00:43:25.170
you should come...

00:43:26.070 --> 00:43:27.769
and eat with us before you go home.

00:44:00.869 --> 00:44:02.670
You didn't have to look for a witness yourself.

00:44:03.639 --> 00:44:05.010
You've watched too many detective shows.

00:44:05.880 --> 00:44:08.380
A witness, my foot. I lied.

00:44:08.749 --> 00:44:09.780
What?

00:44:10.010 --> 00:44:11.849
Grandma, that's considered perjury.

00:44:12.150 --> 00:44:13.280
What were you counting on...

00:44:14.150 --> 00:44:15.220
You, of course.

00:44:16.190 --> 00:44:19.589
There are only two reasons you might hit someone.

00:44:19.590 --> 00:44:20.960
It's always one of these two.

00:44:21.429 --> 00:44:23.929
Actualizing justice or saving a life.

00:44:29.999 --> 00:44:31.039
Do you like her?

00:44:32.070 --> 00:44:33.070
What? Come on.

00:44:35.369 --> 00:44:36.539
She's pretty.

00:44:39.479 --> 00:44:41.249
If it's pity, forget it.

00:44:41.710 --> 00:44:43.920
It must feel so cold and lonely...

00:44:44.380 --> 00:44:46.550
to live in that isolated world all alone.

00:44:47.190 --> 00:44:49.990
If you're going to hurt her down the road, don't even start.

00:44:50.860 --> 00:44:52.920
I don't want to see you hurting.

00:45:17.720 --> 00:45:19.280
I had fun today, thanks to you.

00:45:20.019 --> 00:45:21.050
Get home safely.

00:45:21.619 --> 00:45:22.690
Hey.

00:45:28.289 --> 00:45:30.999
There's no scale that can measure who's hurting more,

00:45:33.229 --> 00:45:34.800
and there's no one who can judge that.

00:45:36.670 --> 00:45:39.340
No one has the right to judge others' pain,

00:45:41.510 --> 00:45:43.570
and we have no duty to have it acknowledged by others.

00:45:45.380 --> 00:45:46.440
You know,

00:45:48.650 --> 00:45:50.179
if you're hurting, just accept it.

00:45:52.249 --> 00:45:54.590
Only you know how much you're hurting.

00:45:57.720 --> 00:45:58.960
I won't force you to look happy.

00:45:59.590 --> 00:46:01.829
A competition to see who's more miserable? Forget that.

00:46:03.659 --> 00:46:06.530
You know, from time to time,

00:46:08.099 --> 00:46:10.170
I hope I can be your prescription.

00:46:12.539 --> 00:46:15.470
Instead of those pills, I wish to be...

00:46:18.110 --> 00:46:20.650
your best friend.

00:46:26.179 --> 00:46:28.249
(Alprazolam)

00:46:51.679 --> 00:46:54.780
Then when your life can twinkle again on its own,

00:46:55.780 --> 00:46:57.949
I hope it twinkles as radiantly as possible.

00:47:01.849 --> 00:47:04.389
I hope that day comes soon...

00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:06.820
because...

00:47:08.530 --> 00:47:10.630
I don't have much time left with me.

00:47:18.970 --> 00:47:20.909
(Restaurant Waryong)

00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:32.479
What took you so long?

00:47:33.789 --> 00:47:35.489
I told you to come at the speed of a missile.

00:47:35.490 --> 00:47:36.748
Hey, what happened?

00:47:36.749 --> 00:47:38.519
What were you doing at the police station?

00:47:38.720 --> 00:47:40.789
And how did you get that wound?

00:47:42.559 --> 00:47:43.590
Hey, Eun Gyeol.

00:47:44.860 --> 00:47:46.699
You get paid to do your job. What do you do?

00:47:47.499 --> 00:47:49.599
- What? - I mean, it's the Jinsung Family.

00:47:51.639 --> 00:47:53.470
They must pay you pretty well.

00:47:54.340 --> 00:47:56.470
Do you only care about fattening your wallet?

00:47:58.539 --> 00:48:01.349
What about Yoon Chung Ah? You don't care about her at all?

00:48:01.579 --> 00:48:04.649
What on earth are you talking about? Explain so I can understand.

00:48:04.650 --> 00:48:05.720
Chung Ah...

00:48:06.979 --> 00:48:08.590
didn't come to the festival, but you didn't even care.

00:48:08.849 --> 00:48:11.019
She doesn't want to go to the song camp, and you don't care.

00:48:11.159 --> 00:48:13.789
Even if she gets insulted in the street, you don't care!

00:48:14.389 --> 00:48:16.460
So tell me, you jerk. What do you do?

00:48:17.460 --> 00:48:18.460
Chung Ah...

00:48:19.760 --> 00:48:21.429
got insulted in the street?

00:48:21.570 --> 00:48:22.599
Forget it.

00:48:24.199 --> 00:48:26.339
I have an important job to do. You'd better cooperate.

00:48:26.340 --> 00:48:28.639
Hey, wait. "An important job?"

00:48:29.309 --> 00:48:31.209
Are you going to get back at those guys?

00:48:31.210 --> 00:48:34.179
You should be ashamed of yourself if you can't even do this for her.

00:48:34.579 --> 00:48:37.050
Yi Chan, don't do this. Calm down!

00:48:55.900 --> 00:48:57.030
I'm sorry, Yi Chan.

00:48:57.670 --> 00:49:00.070
Everything I said the other day was a lie.

00:49:00.340 --> 00:49:03.039
I should get out of the picture for you and Se Gyeong to...

00:49:03.409 --> 00:49:05.380
(I should get out of the picture for you and Se Gyeong to...)

00:49:16.519 --> 00:49:19.989
Chung Ah. It's me, Eun Gyeol. Can you come to the practice room?

00:49:19.990 --> 00:49:21.789
You need to stop Yi Chan. Please!

00:49:55.229 --> 00:49:56.260
Sorry.

00:49:57.300 --> 00:50:00.530
I figured you wouldn't come if I called you here,

00:50:01.229 --> 00:50:02.800
so I asked Eun Gyeol to do it for me.

00:50:18.650 --> 00:50:19.848
(You said first that we should be friends.)

00:50:19.849 --> 00:50:21.590
You said first that we should be friends.

00:50:23.590 --> 00:50:25.590
(And you said you liked me.)

00:50:25.990 --> 00:50:27.729
And you said you liked me.

00:50:30.659 --> 00:50:32.199
(How could you take it back after making my heart flutter?)

00:50:32.599 --> 00:50:34.599
How could you take it back after making my heart flutter?

00:50:38.170 --> 00:50:39.670
How could you not come to the festival?

00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:45.110
How could you not go to the song camp with us?

00:50:48.579 --> 00:50:50.249
(How could you be so mean?)

00:50:50.849 --> 00:50:52.650
How could you be so mean?

00:50:58.860 --> 00:51:02.760
I wanted to sing you a song at the festival.

00:51:08.499 --> 00:51:09.869
But you didn't come to the festival.

00:51:12.369 --> 00:51:14.010
If you can't come to the song camp either...

00:51:18.679 --> 00:51:20.178
(Then I should just do it here.)

00:51:20.179 --> 00:51:21.380
Then I should just do it here.

00:51:33.289 --> 00:51:34.329
Watch carefully.

00:51:35.659 --> 00:51:39.030
This is only for you and no one else.

00:51:52.010 --> 00:51:55.510
Can you believe it?

00:51:57.110 --> 00:52:00.479
In my dreams

00:52:02.490 --> 00:52:09.360
You're a princess under a magic spell

00:52:10.900 --> 00:52:17.999
Even though I always struggle

00:52:18.499 --> 00:52:24.840
With my gestures toward you

00:52:26.440 --> 00:52:33.979
I am strongly determined

00:52:34.420 --> 00:52:41.190
To save you once again

00:52:42.159 --> 00:52:49.829
I put my hands together and prayed

00:52:49.970 --> 00:52:55.510
For endless courage and wisdom

00:52:57.710 --> 00:53:03.749
Past the magic castle and across the swamp

00:53:05.280 --> 00:53:12.360
From afar, I can see you deep inside the dark cave

00:53:13.420 --> 00:53:18.659
Now, hold my hand

00:53:20.630 --> 00:53:27.569
Then we feel our bodies floating into the air

00:53:27.570 --> 00:53:34.849
Freely in the sky

00:53:35.909 --> 00:53:42.190
Don't be surprised even if we fly away together

00:53:43.119 --> 00:53:49.590
The world that will unfold before us

00:53:54.699 --> 00:53:55.769
One moment.

00:55:28.090 --> 00:55:31.030
Gosh, these fools. Don't they know what time it is now?

00:55:31.300 --> 00:55:32.530
Darn it.

00:55:33.960 --> 00:55:36.300
Hey, is Chung Ah really coming?

00:55:36.570 --> 00:55:38.240
Yes, Eun Gyeol called me yesterday.

00:55:41.039 --> 00:55:42.269
Hey, why are you so excited?

00:55:43.039 --> 00:55:46.109
Well, she's growing on me.

00:55:46.110 --> 00:55:47.909
Gosh, not that again.

00:55:48.249 --> 00:55:49.549
Is she really coming with Eun Gyeol?

00:55:49.550 --> 00:55:51.179
I don't know. I guess she'll be here soon.

00:55:52.349 --> 00:55:53.848
Gosh, these two...

00:55:53.849 --> 00:55:54.949
- Sorry we're late! - What?

00:55:55.720 --> 00:55:56.789
What?

00:56:02.429 --> 00:56:03.530
What's going on, you two?

00:56:03.729 --> 00:56:05.900
Don't tell me you two are going out.

00:56:07.599 --> 00:56:08.599
Yes.

00:56:14.340 --> 00:56:16.610
What? You guys knew?

00:56:18.240 --> 00:56:20.308
I knew when Se Gyeong suddenly left...

00:56:20.309 --> 00:56:21.408
in the middle of our performance.

00:56:21.409 --> 00:56:23.308
When Eun Gyeol skipped the wrap-up party and left,

00:56:23.309 --> 00:56:24.320
I thought it was obvious.

00:56:25.249 --> 00:56:28.119
Hey, then Yi Chan... What about Yi Chan, then?

00:56:28.550 --> 00:56:31.289
My gosh. What if he's downing a whole bottle of water somewhere?

00:56:32.190 --> 00:56:34.490
Make some noise, everyone!

00:56:34.729 --> 00:56:37.699
Our designer is here!

00:56:45.539 --> 00:56:47.739
What? You guys knew?

00:56:47.740 --> 00:56:49.739
Yes. I knew when he couldn't stop...

00:56:49.740 --> 00:56:51.339
talking about the guitar pick she gave him.

00:56:51.340 --> 00:56:53.779
It became obvious when he made such a big fuss about Chung Ah...

00:56:53.780 --> 00:56:55.049
not coming to the wrap-up party.

00:56:55.050 --> 00:56:57.820
Am I the only idiot here? How come I didn't know anything?

00:56:58.749 --> 00:57:00.749
You guys. Where did your discipline go?

00:57:00.920 --> 00:57:02.019
You practiced the greeting, right?

00:57:02.449 --> 00:57:03.519
Goodness.

00:57:04.490 --> 00:57:05.559
Attention!

00:57:06.389 --> 00:57:07.619
Parade, rest.

00:57:08.460 --> 00:57:09.530
Attention!

00:57:09.860 --> 00:57:11.960
Greet our designer.

00:57:12.630 --> 00:57:14.599
- Hi, friend. - Hi, friend.

00:57:15.170 --> 00:57:18.570
- Have you been well? - Have you been well?

00:57:19.699 --> 00:57:20.739
My gosh.

00:57:20.740 --> 00:57:22.010
Hi, friends.

00:57:24.240 --> 00:57:26.610
- I think she understood it. - It worked.

00:57:26.880 --> 00:57:28.448
Guys, the train will depart soon.

00:57:28.449 --> 00:57:30.149
Move it!

00:57:30.150 --> 00:57:32.619
- Okay, let's go! - Don't forget your stuff.

00:57:33.349 --> 00:57:35.288
- This way, guys. - Shall we?

00:57:35.289 --> 00:57:36.320
Yes.

00:57:47.900 --> 00:57:49.530
(Cheongnyangni Station)

00:57:49.769 --> 00:57:50.829
Hello.

00:57:57.309 --> 00:57:59.439
Hey, can you check?

00:57:59.440 --> 00:58:00.709
Is this it?

00:58:00.710 --> 00:58:03.178
No, this means "itchy."

00:58:03.179 --> 00:58:06.078
- You try it. - I did, just now. How about "fun?"

00:58:06.079 --> 00:58:07.948
- Show us. - Do it.

00:58:07.949 --> 00:58:09.920
- "It's fun." - That looks like "itchy."

00:58:10.249 --> 00:58:11.959
When it's the former...

00:58:11.960 --> 00:58:14.018
- See that? - This is more...

00:58:14.019 --> 00:58:17.130
The cruel consequences I must suffer for choosing you.

00:58:17.229 --> 00:58:19.859
Got it? All right, you try it now.

00:58:19.860 --> 00:58:21.368
Try "fun."

00:58:21.369 --> 00:58:23.328
I lost all my fans. What will you do about it?

00:58:23.329 --> 00:58:24.970
- Oh, boy. - Hey, try "fun."

00:58:26.570 --> 00:58:27.639
Well...

00:58:29.710 --> 00:58:31.010
I'll be good to you from now on.

00:58:31.979 --> 00:58:34.409
Forget it. Just keep your promise.

00:58:34.679 --> 00:58:35.749
"Promise?"

00:58:36.650 --> 00:58:37.749
What promise?

00:58:38.749 --> 00:58:41.788
Oh, how I said I'd find a way for you to go back?

00:58:41.789 --> 00:58:43.449
- No, not that. - No?

00:58:44.289 --> 00:58:46.019
What else did I promise?

00:58:46.220 --> 00:58:48.059
You promised to work diligently to delay it.

00:58:49.559 --> 00:58:52.860
I think I've missed my chance to take my life because of you.

00:58:53.630 --> 00:58:56.399
Why should I give up my life because of my mom?

00:58:56.400 --> 00:58:57.470
Now, I think it's unfair.

00:58:58.070 --> 00:58:59.840
The star candy gave me a revelation.

00:59:01.170 --> 00:59:03.869
So I'm going to try living my life...

00:59:04.110 --> 00:59:05.510
and have fun while at it.

00:59:06.909 --> 00:59:08.050
So...

00:59:09.380 --> 00:59:11.010
you'd better not hurry.

00:59:11.979 --> 00:59:13.819
If you give up on working diligently toward your goal,

00:59:13.820 --> 00:59:15.619
and if you disappear without a word again,

00:59:16.019 --> 00:59:17.249
you're so dead.

00:59:23.889 --> 00:59:25.759
- Where's the restroom? - To say you like someone...

00:59:25.760 --> 00:59:27.800
- Only I can do this. - Oh, there it is.

00:59:28.199 --> 00:59:31.269
- "I like Chung Ah." - Hey, don't do that.

00:59:32.800 --> 00:59:35.210
- I can profess my feelings too. - "I like you."

00:59:36.340 --> 00:59:37.510
It's not time yet.

00:59:38.510 --> 00:59:39.579
Not today.

00:59:40.380 --> 00:59:41.949
For now, we can be together...

00:59:52.990 --> 00:59:54.420
(1 Missed Call)

00:59:56.229 --> 00:59:57.260
(No Service)

01:00:15.979 --> 01:00:17.110
Shoot.

01:00:18.979 --> 01:00:20.650
(Unisex Toilet)

01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:33.829
This can't be.

01:00:34.599 --> 01:00:35.970
How can this be here?

01:00:40.369 --> 01:00:41.510
(Restricted Caller ID)

01:00:51.619 --> 01:00:52.679
Hello?

01:00:53.679 --> 01:00:55.049
Master, is it you?

01:00:55.050 --> 01:00:59.119
Oh, my. I knew you'd welcome me.

01:01:01.159 --> 01:01:03.288
When did I fall asleep again?

01:01:03.289 --> 01:01:04.289
This is a dream, isn't it?

01:01:04.559 --> 01:01:05.559
Well...

01:01:05.999 --> 01:01:09.769
I do think that your dreamy trip is nearing its end.

01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:14.470
Don't tell me I have to go back to 2023.

01:01:14.610 --> 01:01:17.069
Soon, you will see two moons in the sky.

01:01:17.070 --> 01:01:19.409
- Connecting the two worlds... - I don't want to hear it.

01:01:19.809 --> 01:01:21.549
I don't want to go back yet.

01:01:21.550 --> 01:01:24.109
If I do go back, it'll happen when I want to return. I'm hanging up.

01:01:24.110 --> 01:01:25.449
No, wait.

01:01:25.979 --> 01:01:28.150
You have only one chance to go back.

01:01:28.420 --> 01:01:30.189
If you miss that chance,

01:01:30.190 --> 01:01:32.759
you may get locked up in the past forever.

01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:34.090
Are you okay with that?

01:01:35.190 --> 01:01:37.789
I may get locked up forever?

01:01:38.699 --> 01:01:39.800
Don't worry.

01:01:40.329 --> 01:01:43.929
I sent a special helper to help you out.

01:01:44.070 --> 01:01:46.098
A helper? What kind of helper?

01:01:46.099 --> 01:01:47.800
Your helper...

01:01:47.970 --> 01:01:50.469
and travel companion who will return with you.

01:01:50.470 --> 01:01:51.479
Sorry?

01:01:51.679 --> 01:01:54.909
Are you saying there's another time traveller besides me?

01:01:55.510 --> 01:01:57.549
Who? Where is this person now?

01:01:57.550 --> 01:01:59.419
How can I meet this person?

01:01:59.420 --> 01:02:03.720
This person may be closer than you think.

01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:06.860
Coming soon.

01:02:08.260 --> 01:02:11.159
Wait, mister. I mean, Master! Hello?

01:02:11.659 --> 01:02:13.030
Shoot. Why isn't this working?

01:02:23.139 --> 01:02:25.280
Darn it. Please work.

01:02:35.619 --> 01:02:37.449
- Hey. - What are you doing?

01:03:03.210 --> 01:03:05.349
The time traveller Master was talking about...

01:03:06.119 --> 01:03:07.849
The helper Master was talking about...

01:03:08.619 --> 01:03:09.619
- It was you? - It was you?

01:03:11.590 --> 01:03:14.420
(Special thanks to Cheong Kyu Soo, Lee So Hee, and Kang Yi Seok)

01:03:41.650 --> 01:03:46.489
(Twinkling Watermelon)

01:03:46.490 --> 01:03:48.389
How could you be the other time traveller?

01:03:48.490 --> 01:03:51.189
So, you've been hitting on my mom?

01:03:51.190 --> 01:03:53.459
I'll make sure I raise Chung Ah...

01:03:53.460 --> 01:03:55.098
to be the future leader of the Jinsung Family.

01:03:55.099 --> 01:03:57.029
I haven't completed all my missions yet.

01:03:57.030 --> 01:03:59.268
I have yet to complete the most challenging one.

01:03:59.269 --> 01:04:00.269
What is it?

01:04:00.270 --> 01:04:02.569
You must've heard of White Night, the legendary rock band.

01:04:02.570 --> 01:04:04.839
That man over there was the front man of that band.

01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:07.239
Are there any magazines with articles about that band?

01:04:07.240 --> 01:04:09.478
Yi Chan, help me. Come and get me.

01:04:09.479 --> 01:04:12.049
What are you people trying to do in this house?

01:04:12.050 --> 01:04:13.748
What brings you here?

01:04:13.749 --> 01:04:15.320
I want to know about my mom.
