00:01:00.615 --> 00:01:03.045
I can't believe I didn't recognize Mr. Viva.

Mom.

00:01:20.595 --> 00:01:21.634
I did...

00:01:22.735 --> 00:01:24.535
all sorts of disgusting things...

00:01:25.104 --> 00:01:26.773
to make you a member of the Jinsung Family,

00:01:26.774 --> 00:01:28.574
so it was your job to protect it.

00:01:29.175 --> 00:01:32.615
Forget his secret child. Even if his dead son came back to life,

00:01:32.714 --> 00:01:34.445
you should've protected it no matter what.

00:01:35.414 --> 00:01:38.455
How could you not win Mr. Chairman's affections even once?

00:01:39.315 --> 00:01:40.814
Even that boy from who knows where...

00:01:40.815 --> 00:01:42.785
managed to grab his attention at once!

00:01:43.285 --> 00:01:44.925
I'll just go and kill myself, then.

00:01:45.494 --> 00:01:49.294
I'll do it for you, if that's what you want.

00:01:53.535 --> 00:01:54.764
Hey, come on.

00:01:55.535 --> 00:01:56.834
You said so.

00:01:56.835 --> 00:01:59.633
- Hey. - What are you doing?

00:01:59.634 --> 00:02:01.174
Why did he suddenly come back to Korea?

00:02:01.175 --> 00:02:02.645
Did you not hear the rumours?

00:02:02.705 --> 00:02:04.744
Chairman Yoon's secret son showed up.

00:02:05.414 --> 00:02:07.244
I hear he's very smart and good-looking.

00:02:07.914 --> 00:02:09.785
That idiot is like a deposed crown prince now.

00:02:12.585 --> 00:02:13.615
Yes.

00:02:14.255 --> 00:02:17.154
That jerk should be the one dying, not me.

00:02:35.644 --> 00:02:37.845

Dad...

00:03:28.595 --> 00:03:29.824
I thought about it...

00:03:30.794 --> 00:03:34.095
and realized that everything you had asked me to do was for my own sake.

00:03:37.805 --> 00:03:38.834
I'm sorry.

00:03:41.604 --> 00:03:42.805
I'm sorry, Yi Chan.

00:03:44.174 --> 00:03:45.315
Just today...

00:03:47.174 --> 00:03:49.884
All I had to do was stay right by your side for just this one day.

00:03:52.255 --> 00:03:54.414
I should have protected you.

00:03:56.424 --> 00:03:57.725
This is all my fault.

00:03:59.394 --> 00:04:01.625
It's all my fault. I'm sorry, Yi Chan.

00:04:07.234 --> 00:04:09.405
I wonder if there's been an accident or something.

00:04:10.905 --> 00:04:13.035
I hope it's not a big accident.

00:04:15.204 --> 00:04:18.174
Hey, it's getting late. Where are you going?

00:04:18.375 --> 00:04:20.044

Is Ha Yi Chan's guardian here?

00:04:36.425 --> 00:04:38.495
I'm his guardian. I am his cousin.

00:04:38.594 --> 00:04:41.403
We need his guardian's signature to perform emergency surgery.

Hey, I'll go.

00:04:45.334 --> 00:04:47.204
Go to the restroom and wash up.

00:05:20.474 --> 00:05:21.505
No way.

00:05:22.445 --> 00:05:24.105

All right, everyone. Look here!

00:07:02.545 --> 00:07:03.774
Grandma, look at the camera.

00:07:03.974 --> 00:07:05.175
Come on, guys.

00:07:07.274 --> 00:07:09.144
We only have five seconds. Come on, quick!

Thank you for raising me, Grandma.

00:07:38.245 --> 00:07:41.175
It's a holiday, so there weren't many cars. How did this happen?

00:07:41.445 --> 00:07:44.245
He pushed away a guy who was running and got hit instead of him.

00:07:44.344 --> 00:07:46.454
- Really? - My goodness. What a scumbag.

00:07:46.485 --> 00:07:49.284
How could this jerk run away after hitting someone with his car?

00:07:49.824 --> 00:07:50.954
Oh, dear.

00:08:00.334 --> 00:08:02.764
I'm sure of it. I saw the car with my own eyes.

00:08:03.065 --> 00:08:06.034
It was the only car that left the scene at the time of the accident.

00:08:06.474 --> 00:08:09.404
The plate number was Seoul 2, NA 4836.

00:08:09.675 --> 00:08:11.514
I don't know the model, but it was a red sports car.

00:08:12.175 --> 00:08:13.544
Please, you must catch this person.

00:08:13.545 --> 00:08:15.284
This hit-and-run driver hit someone with his car.

00:08:15.485 --> 00:08:16.884
No, he should be charged with attempted murder.

00:08:16.915 --> 00:08:19.485
Please calm down. Which way did he go?

00:08:19.714 --> 00:08:21.485
That way, toward the main road.

00:08:32.165 --> 00:08:35.134
Yi Chan is the one who got hurt in the accident?

00:08:39.474 --> 00:08:40.505
He was on his way here...

00:08:42.875 --> 00:08:44.843
to have me listen to this?

00:08:44.844 --> 00:08:46.374
("A Song for You")

00:08:46.545 --> 00:08:50.015
Yes, I think so.

00:08:52.315 --> 00:08:54.584
We tried so hard to prevent this from happening.

00:08:57.754 --> 00:09:00.525
That cassette tape ended up in your hands, after all.

00:09:06.165 --> 00:09:09.104
Please burn it with your own hands.

00:09:10.165 --> 00:09:11.265
Something tells me...

00:09:12.074 --> 00:09:14.435
that it's the only thing that can break this chain of misfortunes.

00:09:16.744 --> 00:09:17.775
You know, earlier...

00:09:19.874 --> 00:09:23.015
I'm sorry I didn't say anything at all.

00:09:27.584 --> 00:09:28.724
By any chance...

00:09:30.655 --> 00:09:32.395
Did you come back to see me?

00:09:33.994 --> 00:09:37.364
Mom, if you could go back to that moment in time,

00:09:37.864 --> 00:09:39.164
what's the first thing you'd ask him?

00:09:39.165 --> 00:09:40.265
(Spring 2022)

00:09:41.035 --> 00:09:42.405
"Why did you abandon me?"

00:09:43.435 --> 00:09:44.775
Something like that, I guess.

00:09:45.374 --> 00:09:46.704
Why couldn't you ask him that question?

00:09:49.445 --> 00:09:51.915
I think I was afraid of facing the truth.

00:09:53.874 --> 00:09:55.915
He was probably afraid too.

00:09:56.315 --> 00:09:59.114
Because he had nothing to say if I were to ask that question.

00:10:05.324 --> 00:10:06.795
If you came back...

00:10:07.655 --> 00:10:10.195
because you wanted to talk to me about something...

00:10:10.425 --> 00:10:11.734
Why did you abandon me?

00:10:14.535 --> 00:10:17.034
The day I asked you about Shin A Young, the actress,

00:10:17.035 --> 00:10:18.234
you told me...

00:10:19.834 --> 00:10:21.775
that it was love, not just a fling.

00:10:22.844 --> 00:10:25.645
You said you found out about me and Shin A Young's death...

00:10:26.344 --> 00:10:27.974
after I was adopted...

00:10:28.114 --> 00:10:30.984
and that you never abandoned me.

00:10:32.484 --> 00:10:33.815
- Se Gyeong. - What you said that day...

00:10:34.815 --> 00:10:35.954
I will try to believe it.

00:10:36.025 --> 00:10:37.724
I will try to understand you, but you see...

00:10:39.354 --> 00:10:40.494
If that was the case,

00:10:41.094 --> 00:10:43.695
shouldn't you have looked for your daughter once you found out?

00:10:44.864 --> 00:10:46.795
You never abandoned me because you simply didn't know?

00:10:47.734 --> 00:10:49.334
Don't you think it's so irresponsible?

00:10:51.104 --> 00:10:52.535
You looked happy.

00:10:54.135 --> 00:10:57.275
A wealthy family and wonderful adoptive parents.

00:10:58.104 --> 00:11:00.713
You were growing up well, enjoying a happy childhood.

00:11:00.714 --> 00:11:01.785
I did not want...

00:11:02.885 --> 00:11:04.884
to ruin your happy life.

00:11:04.885 --> 00:11:07.385
Your daughter has never once felt happy.

00:11:09.824 --> 00:11:12.224
She was always anxious, having to live someone else's life,

00:11:12.525 --> 00:11:13.754
and she often felt miserable.

00:11:15.265 --> 00:11:18.123
She had to surpass Han Na, her adoptive parents' real daughter.

00:11:18.124 --> 00:11:19.534
She thought it was the only way to be loved.

00:11:19.535 --> 00:11:20.535
She never once...

00:11:21.334 --> 00:11:23.305
lived as Choi Se Gyeong.

00:11:24.834 --> 00:11:26.374
So, say this as your answer.

00:11:27.275 --> 00:11:30.844
If someone who looks just like me asks you the same question,

00:11:31.275 --> 00:11:32.945
tell her this over and over.

00:11:33.675 --> 00:11:35.884
"I never once abandoned you."

00:11:35.885 --> 00:11:37.315
"You're not Han Na."

00:11:38.214 --> 00:11:40.114
"You're my daughter born of love,"

00:11:41.354 --> 00:11:42.525
"Choi Se Gyeong."

00:11:45.594 --> 00:11:46.895
If you don't tell her,

00:11:47.724 --> 00:11:49.124
she'll never know.

00:11:56.265 --> 00:11:57.305
That's it, no more.

00:11:57.964 --> 00:11:59.734
The rest is up to you people to figure out.

00:11:59.905 --> 00:12:00.974
I won't meddle anymore.

00:12:01.334 --> 00:12:03.175
I'm afraid something else might change.

00:12:04.374 --> 00:12:07.344
I'm afraid I might fail to protect my loved ones, like Yi Chan.

00:12:08.885 --> 00:12:11.415
I want to go home now.

00:13:00.695 --> 00:13:02.864
(Operating Room, Intensive Care Unit)

00:13:11.145 --> 00:13:12.344
Who are you, really?

00:13:12.945 --> 00:13:15.145
Tomorrow night, two full moons will rise.

00:13:20.555 --> 00:13:23.154
When the two full moons appear in the sky,

00:13:23.155 --> 00:13:24.753
the gate that connects the past to the present...

00:13:24.754 --> 00:13:26.795
or the present to the future will open.

00:13:27.094 --> 00:13:28.824
What does that have to do with me?

00:13:28.994 --> 00:13:30.623
Wrap up your journey...

00:13:30.624 --> 00:13:32.765
and come to the place where you arrived.

00:13:32.964 --> 00:13:34.065
As I had promised,

00:13:34.565 --> 00:13:37.464
I'll keep the lights on at La Vida Music.

00:13:37.734 --> 00:13:38.775
Oh, right.

00:13:39.374 --> 00:13:41.573
I'll also have lavender tea ready as your welcome tea.

00:13:41.574 --> 00:13:42.744
Do you think...

00:13:44.604 --> 00:13:46.474
I can go back in this situation?

00:13:46.675 --> 00:13:50.214
Tomorrow is your only chance to go back.

00:13:52.155 --> 00:13:53.554
If you decide to stay,

00:13:53.555 --> 00:13:56.084
your life in 2023...

00:13:56.954 --> 00:13:58.055
will disappear.

00:13:59.295 --> 00:14:00.824
Will you be okay with that?

00:14:01.964 --> 00:14:03.593
You do not belong to this world,

00:14:03.594 --> 00:14:07.494
so we cannot even predict what kinds of ripple effects...

00:14:08.165 --> 00:14:10.334
your existence in this world might bring about.

00:14:11.665 --> 00:14:12.675
Are you...

00:14:13.535 --> 00:14:14.974
really okay with that?

00:14:16.645 --> 00:14:18.175
Why are you doing this to me?

00:14:19.145 --> 00:14:21.145
What on earth did I do?

00:14:21.675 --> 00:14:23.484
What did I do so wrong...

00:14:23.614 --> 00:14:25.584
that I've ended up in such a ridiculous situation?

00:14:28.015 --> 00:14:29.354
Whatever you decide,

00:14:30.354 --> 00:14:33.124
I truly hope that you make a choice for your own sake.

00:14:35.055 --> 00:14:36.195
- Goodbye. - Don't hang up.

00:14:36.464 --> 00:14:37.594
I told you not to hang up.

00:14:37.925 --> 00:14:40.464
I told you not to hang up! I'm not done talking yet!

00:14:47.405 --> 00:14:50.045
Hey, Eun Gyeol.

00:14:51.474 --> 00:14:53.145
They just finished Yi Chan's surgery.

00:14:54.445 --> 00:14:56.785
How did it go? Did the surgery go well?

00:14:57.315 --> 00:14:58.453
Yes, it went well.

00:14:58.454 --> 00:15:00.055
They said he'd be okay, for sure.

00:15:00.454 --> 00:15:02.055
He'll soon be moved to a regular ward.

00:15:04.624 --> 00:15:05.795
(Yeonnam Hospital)

00:15:22.645 --> 00:15:23.675
Yi Chan.

00:15:28.815 --> 00:15:29.885
Dad.

00:15:34.555 --> 00:15:35.584
I'm sorry, Dad.

00:15:38.525 --> 00:15:40.155
Had I not come here,

00:15:41.994 --> 00:15:43.565
this wouldn't have happened.

00:15:46.964 --> 00:15:48.035
Dad.

00:15:52.574 --> 00:15:55.405
The fact that you can't hear wasn't the reason I said nothing to you.

00:15:58.374 --> 00:15:59.415
Dad.

00:16:04.984 --> 00:16:05.984
I didn't say...

00:16:07.685 --> 00:16:09.685
those mean things to you because I hated you.

00:16:15.055 --> 00:16:16.994
I love you very much, Dad.

00:16:22.464 --> 00:16:23.535
So please...

00:16:28.805 --> 00:16:31.675
Please open your eyes.

00:16:35.885 --> 00:16:38.713
There's something I must tell you.

00:16:38.714 --> 00:16:40.515
You can't keep on sleeping like this.

00:16:42.454 --> 00:16:43.525
Also...

00:16:48.025 --> 00:16:49.025
I might have to...

00:16:50.025 --> 00:16:52.334
go back soon.

00:17:09.915 --> 00:17:11.954
(Yeonnam Hospital)

00:17:21.655 --> 00:17:22.695
Yi Chan.

00:17:31.464 --> 00:17:32.504
Yi Chan.

00:17:49.284 --> 00:17:51.685
Hey, something's wrong with me.

00:17:53.224 --> 00:17:54.355
I can't hear anything.

00:17:59.895 --> 00:18:01.234
I can't even hear my own voice.

00:18:20.385 --> 00:18:21.585
Gosh, Ms. Go.

00:18:22.224 --> 00:18:24.155
You'll trip and fall. Slow down.

00:18:29.794 --> 00:18:30.825
My gosh.

00:18:46.615 --> 00:18:47.844
We can't keep this a secret forever.

00:18:47.845 --> 00:18:49.484
It's not like he can go home in a day or two.

00:18:59.794 --> 00:19:02.794
Oh, dear. My goodness.

00:19:05.195 --> 00:19:06.264
Do you recognize me?

00:19:07.034 --> 00:19:09.204
Ms. Go, I told you that he was totally fine mentally.

00:19:09.865 --> 00:19:12.234
Who am I? Answer my question at once.

00:19:14.504 --> 00:19:15.875
You're my grandma.

00:19:17.605 --> 00:19:19.075
Do you hear my voice?

00:19:25.314 --> 00:19:27.784
I'll be home soon. Why did you come here?

00:19:28.514 --> 00:19:31.625
I was happy, thinking I could take a break from your nagging.

00:19:31.784 --> 00:19:33.695
Do you hear my voice?

00:19:36.695 --> 00:19:37.895
I'm sorry, Grandma.

00:19:40.135 --> 00:19:42.763
You said you adored me because I was healthy physically and mentally.

00:19:42.764 --> 00:19:43.905
What should I do now?

00:19:45.905 --> 00:19:46.935
To make up for what happened,

00:19:48.575 --> 00:19:51.175
I'll try to cultivate a more beautiful heart.

00:19:52.615 --> 00:19:54.575
I'll focus on building that muscle.

00:19:56.314 --> 00:19:58.714
Gosh, my sweetheart.

00:19:59.915 --> 00:20:02.354
They say all good things must come to an end.

00:20:02.355 --> 00:20:05.494
How could something like this happen?

00:20:06.355 --> 00:20:10.365
I've never seen anyone kinder than my grandson.

00:20:10.964 --> 00:20:13.463
What did my sweet grandson do to deserve this?

00:20:13.464 --> 00:20:15.604
I can't believe this.

00:20:15.605 --> 00:20:17.303
Oh, dear.

00:20:17.304 --> 00:20:19.174
Grandma, why are you crying?

00:20:19.175 --> 00:20:20.504
It's not like I'm dead.

00:20:21.905 --> 00:20:24.473
I was always so busy cooking for others...

00:20:24.474 --> 00:20:27.575
that I never once properly fed you or clothed you.

00:20:28.845 --> 00:20:31.445
You never even experienced your parents' love,

00:20:32.314 --> 00:20:34.454
and yet I always picked on you.

00:20:35.254 --> 00:20:40.954
I've never once warmly embraced you.

00:20:41.294 --> 00:20:42.763
What should we do now?

00:20:42.764 --> 00:20:45.165
Grandma.

00:20:48.865 --> 00:20:52.575
- Gosh, what should we do? - Grandma.

00:20:56.044 --> 00:20:59.544
Let's ask them to carefully examine you,

00:21:00.145 --> 00:21:02.014
from head to toe.

00:21:02.415 --> 00:21:04.114
If they say they can't fix it,

00:21:04.115 --> 00:21:06.954
I will give you my ears.

00:21:07.484 --> 00:21:10.483
If it is a new heart that you need, I will give you mine.

00:21:10.484 --> 00:21:13.855
If you need new eyes, I will give you both of my eyes.

00:21:15.395 --> 00:21:18.864
Oh, dear. What should we do? You poor thing.

00:21:18.865 --> 00:21:21.293
My sweetheart, what are we going to do?

00:21:21.294 --> 00:21:23.635
Gosh, my sweet grandson.

00:21:24.504 --> 00:21:26.734
I will fix you. Don't you worry.

00:21:29.244 --> 00:21:32.273
I will give you my heart and my eyes too.

00:21:32.274 --> 00:21:33.974
I'll give you whatever you need.

00:21:34.675 --> 00:21:35.945
Hey, Eun Gyeol.

00:21:37.514 --> 00:21:39.685
What's going on? Where are you going?

00:21:39.855 --> 00:21:41.615
To find the scumbag who made Yi Chan like that.

00:21:41.885 --> 00:21:43.584
If the police can't find the driver, I will.

00:21:43.585 --> 00:21:46.125
I will find him and kill him.

00:21:47.125 --> 00:21:49.064
They already caught the driver, so calm down.

00:21:49.825 --> 00:21:51.224
They caught him this morning.

00:21:51.395 --> 00:21:53.395
I just checked. I'm coming from the police station.

00:21:54.234 --> 00:21:55.264
But the thing is,

00:21:56.534 --> 00:21:59.234
I think it's better that we don't tell Yi Chan or his grandmother.

00:21:59.774 --> 00:22:00.935
What do you mean?

00:22:02.274 --> 00:22:03.304
Why?

00:22:06.044 --> 00:22:07.274
Is it someone we know?

00:22:08.075 --> 00:22:09.085
Yes.

00:22:09.915 --> 00:22:12.145
It's Yoon Ju Yeop, Chung Ah's stepbrother.

00:22:45.784 --> 00:22:48.115
Do you want to tag along on my upcoming business trip?

00:22:48.714 --> 00:22:51.585
I'm going to a place with many art galleries, so you'll have fun.

00:22:56.325 --> 00:22:57.665
Paintings.

00:22:58.665 --> 00:22:59.865
You like them, right?

00:23:02.234 --> 00:23:03.234
Did I get it wrong?

00:23:04.064 --> 00:23:05.605
("The Most Beautiful Language: Lovely Sign Language")

00:23:15.645 --> 00:23:17.585
You can look...

00:23:18.615 --> 00:23:19.655
at paintings,

00:23:21.014 --> 00:23:23.925
and I'll make some time...

00:23:24.925 --> 00:23:26.024
so we can take a trip...

00:23:34.835 --> 00:23:36.435
I really want you to see it.

00:23:37.605 --> 00:23:38.605
See what?

00:23:38.764 --> 00:23:40.105
Chung Ah's smile.

00:23:41.875 --> 00:23:43.244
She has such a pretty smile.

00:23:52.014 --> 00:23:53.355
I'll join you.

00:24:20.474 --> 00:24:22.514
I told you. It wasn't intentional.

00:24:24.185 --> 00:24:26.414
He suddenly jumped in front of my car.

00:24:26.415 --> 00:24:28.915
I meant to hit the brakes, but I was so startled...

00:24:29.155 --> 00:24:31.223
that I stepped on the accelerator by mistake.

00:24:31.224 --> 00:24:32.895
How many times do I have to tell you?

00:24:34.294 --> 00:24:35.964
That's really odd.

00:24:36.224 --> 00:24:39.234
The skid marks on the road tell a different story.

00:24:40.494 --> 00:24:42.034
What are you, a psychic?

00:24:42.234 --> 00:24:45.064
Do cops have the ability to commune with asphalt or something?

00:24:46.004 --> 00:24:47.604
You'd better strategize wisely.

00:24:47.605 --> 00:24:49.743
It'll be considered attempted murder if we prove that it was intentional.

00:24:49.744 --> 00:24:51.004
I told you it wasn't intentional...

00:24:53.115 --> 00:24:54.175
Forget it.

00:24:54.375 --> 00:24:57.544
I won't say a word more until my attorney gets here, so...

00:24:59.054 --> 00:25:00.085
It was intentional.

00:25:00.484 --> 00:25:03.325
You saw me and drove straight toward me.

00:25:03.484 --> 00:25:05.524
Stop. We're at a police station now, Eun Gyeol.

00:25:05.585 --> 00:25:08.094
Thank you for letting him know and telling him to stop.

00:25:08.095 --> 00:25:09.325
You tried to kill me.

00:25:09.825 --> 00:25:10.895
You were trying to kill me,

00:25:11.564 --> 00:25:13.493
but Yi Chan got hit because he tried to save me!

00:25:13.494 --> 00:25:14.764
Darn you, seriously!

00:25:14.964 --> 00:25:16.905
You're falsely accusing me. Do you have evidence?

00:25:17.935 --> 00:25:19.034
I will kill you.

00:25:19.234 --> 00:25:21.134
If you bribe your way out of this, I'll follow you...

00:25:21.135 --> 00:25:22.544
to the end of the world and punish you myself.

00:25:22.905 --> 00:25:25.375
I will do anything and everything you're imagining and are afraid of.

00:25:25.445 --> 00:25:28.774
I will latch on to you like a leech and kill you slowly.

00:25:29.385 --> 00:25:31.414
Don't complicate things. Let's get out of here, okay?

00:25:31.415 --> 00:25:32.484
I will kill you.

00:25:33.385 --> 00:25:35.615
I won't leave you alone until the day you die!

00:25:35.954 --> 00:25:37.254
I will kill you!

00:25:37.554 --> 00:25:38.825
Darn it.

00:25:39.395 --> 00:25:40.625
When will my attorney get here?

00:25:42.794 --> 00:25:44.125
Can I make a phone call?

00:25:44.994 --> 00:25:47.665
This is a democratic country. You can let me do that much, right?

00:26:02.615 --> 00:26:04.514
The two moons will rise tonight.

00:26:06.155 --> 00:26:07.685
Master called you too, right?

00:26:09.685 --> 00:26:12.494
This is where we stop. We shouldn't meddle anymore.

00:26:13.724 --> 00:26:15.095
We must go back.

00:26:15.524 --> 00:26:16.695
Not now.

00:26:17.994 --> 00:26:20.935
If we don't go back today, we'll be trapped here forever.

00:26:20.994 --> 00:26:23.435
Until I make sure everything can go back to the way it used to be,

00:26:25.935 --> 00:26:27.335
I will not go back.

00:26:27.405 --> 00:26:28.474
But how?

00:26:28.905 --> 00:26:31.004
How will you undo something that already happened?

00:26:31.544 --> 00:26:32.714
By going back to the past?

00:26:32.875 --> 00:26:35.375
And you'll travel further back in time if something else changes?

00:26:35.845 --> 00:26:37.185
Come to your senses.

00:26:37.415 --> 00:26:39.283
You must go back to 2023.

00:26:39.284 --> 00:26:40.554
How could I go back?

00:26:43.325 --> 00:26:45.454
Knowing my dad's life got ruined because of me...

00:26:46.554 --> 00:26:48.325
and that I couldn't change anything.

00:26:53.365 --> 00:26:56.504
I should've just let things unfold the way they were supposed to.

00:26:57.835 --> 00:26:59.375
I shouldn't have stepped in.

00:27:01.704 --> 00:27:03.105
What do you mean you changed nothing?

00:27:06.514 --> 00:27:07.675
You saved me,

00:27:11.185 --> 00:27:12.814
and you rescued Chung Ah.

00:27:36.875 --> 00:27:39.875
Yi Chan, I'm going on a trip with my dad.

00:27:40.774 --> 00:27:43.345
I'm just tagging along on his work trip,

00:27:43.714 --> 00:27:47.214
but this is my first trip with him, so I'm a little excited.

00:28:04.865 --> 00:28:06.234
(Subway Safety Maintenance to Be Strengthened)

00:28:47.544 --> 00:28:48.575
Thanks.

00:28:49.314 --> 00:28:50.845
I owe it all to you.

00:28:52.244 --> 00:28:56.385
Knowing that someone's always on my side makes me very happy.

00:28:57.685 --> 00:29:00.925
It makes me feel safe and gives me courage.

00:29:02.355 --> 00:29:04.524
For some reason, it helps me become stronger.

00:29:06.165 --> 00:29:09.635
I hope I can do the same for you.

00:29:16.744 --> 00:29:18.744
To Yi Chan, who's always on my side.

00:29:19.145 --> 00:29:21.274
From Chung Ah, who's always on your side.

00:29:26.484 --> 00:29:28.814
Please find a good school overseas for Chung Ah.

00:29:29.524 --> 00:29:30.554
Sure thing, sir.

00:29:30.724 --> 00:29:33.824
I heard about Gallaudet University. It's a college for the deaf.

00:29:33.825 --> 00:29:35.825
Look into their admission requirements as well.

00:29:36.425 --> 00:29:37.464
Even college?

00:29:38.024 --> 00:29:39.024
Chung Ah...

00:29:40.964 --> 00:29:43.034
will not come back once she leaves Korea this time.

00:29:45.935 --> 00:29:47.605
Please don't tell Chung Ah.

00:29:48.004 --> 00:29:49.804
Well understood, sir.

00:29:50.044 --> 00:29:53.514
Also, we'll cover Yi Chan's medical expenses and all his tuition fees...

00:29:53.845 --> 00:29:55.274
until he graduates from college.

00:29:55.514 --> 00:29:56.685
I'll proceed accordingly, sir.

00:29:58.014 --> 00:29:59.314
As for the case involving Ju Yeop,

00:29:59.655 --> 00:30:02.314
I will not cooperate no matter what the legal team...

00:30:03.185 --> 00:30:04.425
asks me to do.

00:30:07.395 --> 00:30:08.454
Ms. Im Ji Mi.

00:30:09.294 --> 00:30:10.764
We're from the National Tax Service.

00:30:10.925 --> 00:30:13.135
You've just been banned from leaving the country due to a tax audit.

00:30:16.435 --> 00:30:18.234
I'm sure all your efforts...

00:30:18.504 --> 00:30:20.575
changed the situation for the better.

00:30:21.435 --> 00:30:22.575
So...

00:30:23.375 --> 00:30:24.605
let's stop here...

00:30:25.105 --> 00:30:26.645
and now return to the world where we belong.

00:30:27.445 --> 00:30:28.544
But...

00:30:30.244 --> 00:30:31.385
I cannot leave.

00:30:31.885 --> 00:30:34.284
Would you be happy if your life in 2023 completely disappeared?

00:30:34.885 --> 00:30:36.724
My dad is in utter despair now.

00:30:37.885 --> 00:30:39.494
I can't ditch him and run away alone.

00:30:41.355 --> 00:30:43.764
Now, I understand what Eun Ho meant.

00:30:44.925 --> 00:30:46.634
Back then, I couldn't fully understand him...

00:30:46.635 --> 00:30:48.463
as I didn't know much sign language,

00:30:48.464 --> 00:30:49.504
but I get it now.

00:30:51.064 --> 00:30:52.405
The reason...

00:30:52.804 --> 00:30:54.804
Eun Ho didn't tell you about your dad's accident.

00:30:56.375 --> 00:30:58.145
When will you show your brother?

00:31:00.714 --> 00:31:03.415
When the burden on his shoulders becomes lighter.

00:31:05.284 --> 00:31:07.284
Right now, it seems a little too heavy.

00:31:09.425 --> 00:31:12.325
Put down the burden already. It's not your burden to carry.

00:31:14.054 --> 00:31:15.754
You forced yourself to take on the burden.

00:31:17.524 --> 00:31:19.264
Do you think it made them happy?

00:31:20.335 --> 00:31:21.365
No.

00:31:21.865 --> 00:31:24.534
On the contrary, it made them worry, and it made them sad.

00:31:25.264 --> 00:31:27.335
They worried that you'd become more miserable because of them.

00:31:30.445 --> 00:31:33.274
No one can live your life for you.

00:31:35.575 --> 00:31:37.645
Let Yi Chan in 1995...

00:31:38.014 --> 00:31:40.385
figure things out on his own.

00:31:41.284 --> 00:31:42.655
Believe in Yi Chan.

00:31:43.855 --> 00:31:47.454
Yi Chan and Chung Ah exist in 2023 too.

00:31:48.095 --> 00:31:49.155
Eun Ho is there too.

00:31:50.724 --> 00:31:52.494
There are people who are waiting for you.

00:31:53.895 --> 00:31:55.135
And I live in that world too.

00:32:03.845 --> 00:32:05.044
I will go back.

00:32:06.274 --> 00:32:08.444
Pack your things and meet me at my place at 9pm.

00:32:08.445 --> 00:32:09.484
I'll be waiting for you.

00:32:18.855 --> 00:32:20.395
You could flip a coin.

It's been a while, Mr. Viva.

00:34:46.374 --> 00:34:48.575
I thought I'd never see you again.

00:34:50.475 --> 00:34:51.544
But we meet again like this.

00:35:06.825 --> 00:35:09.195
Oh, my. Brava.

00:35:10.794 --> 00:35:13.635
I thought you just felt a little lost for a short while.

00:35:13.964 --> 00:35:16.064
But you were a lot more rebellious than I thought.

00:35:17.265 --> 00:35:18.334
What are you?

00:35:19.874 --> 00:35:21.035
Who are you?

00:35:21.334 --> 00:35:23.104

On Eun Yu, Choi Se Gyeong's daughter from the future.

00:35:28.874 --> 00:35:31.285
I must be going crazy. I'm losing my sanity.

00:35:31.584 --> 00:35:33.455
I've lost my mind.

00:35:34.414 --> 00:35:35.885
Hey, wait.

00:35:36.955 --> 00:35:37.984
Just one moment.

00:35:38.754 --> 00:35:41.354
Since I've already revealed myself, let me say a few more things.

00:35:42.225 --> 00:35:44.925
Keep that rebellious spirit and tell your adoptive parents...

00:35:45.464 --> 00:35:47.234
that you can't replace Han Na.

00:35:48.035 --> 00:35:50.204
And you had to pluck up your courage to meet your birth father,

00:35:50.205 --> 00:35:51.234
so go back and ask him.

00:35:51.934 --> 00:35:52.964
"Why did you abandon me?"

00:35:53.705 --> 00:35:56.905
Then he'll answer your question as if he's been waiting for it.

00:35:57.575 --> 00:36:01.374
And just like you can't replace Han Na,

00:36:01.714 --> 00:36:03.814
I can't live your life for you, Mom.

00:36:04.885 --> 00:36:07.814
So, go ahead and live your life, Mom.

00:36:08.655 --> 00:36:09.684
You deserve it.

00:36:10.655 --> 00:36:12.284
Why? Because...

00:36:12.285 --> 00:36:15.155
you're charming and cool just as you are.

00:36:20.434 --> 00:36:22.163
Oh, you can run away now.

00:36:22.164 --> 00:36:23.205
I'm busy too.

00:36:23.535 --> 00:36:25.603
I'll tidy up here,

00:36:25.604 --> 00:36:26.635
so don't worry.

00:36:27.035 --> 00:36:29.305
You cleaned my room for me for years, Mom.

00:36:32.345 --> 00:36:34.975
This has to be a dream. I'm seeing things.

00:36:36.115 --> 00:36:37.285
This can't be real.

00:36:41.414 --> 00:36:42.714
I can't see you out!

00:36:45.285 --> 00:36:46.425
Bye, Mom.

00:36:47.995 --> 00:36:49.354
We'll meet again 28 years later.

00:36:58.604 --> 00:36:59.805
Ask away.

00:37:00.905 --> 00:37:02.575
It's written all over your face.

00:37:03.475 --> 00:37:05.644
Your mind is full of questions now.

00:37:08.575 --> 00:37:12.084
I debated whether I should flip a coin before coming here.

00:37:13.184 --> 00:37:14.254
You read my mind.

00:37:15.555 --> 00:37:16.624
A coin?

00:37:16.925 --> 00:37:19.254
Someone once advised me...

00:37:20.325 --> 00:37:21.925
to try flipping a coin...

00:37:24.325 --> 00:37:26.124
if I ever had to make a difficult decision.

00:37:28.464 --> 00:37:30.964

Se Gyeong told me to burn it,

00:37:37.475 --> 00:37:39.975
but I really think you should take a listen.

00:37:40.544 --> 00:37:42.945
The song is great. Make sure you listen to it to the end.

00:37:50.825 --> 00:37:52.484
Did I ever tell you?

00:37:54.894 --> 00:37:56.564
My parents are deaf.

00:37:57.725 --> 00:37:59.725
I have a brother who's a year older than me.

00:38:00.765 --> 00:38:01.765
He's also deaf.

00:38:03.905 --> 00:38:06.064
A child like me...

00:38:06.234 --> 00:38:08.405
who was born to deaf parents...

00:38:09.604 --> 00:38:10.805
is called a CODA.

00:38:12.575 --> 00:38:13.644
"CODA?"

00:38:14.774 --> 00:38:18.143
People who do music all understand what this means.

00:38:18.144 --> 00:38:19.955
It's like a code word.

00:38:20.354 --> 00:38:21.455
It's called a coda.

00:38:22.055 --> 00:38:24.683
When you see a coda near the end of a song,

00:38:24.684 --> 00:38:29.124
you know you should get ready to wrap it up beautifully.

00:38:31.164 --> 00:38:32.524
That's why I came to see you.

00:38:33.664 --> 00:38:34.964
I think it's time...

00:38:36.234 --> 00:38:38.834
to get ready to wrap things up beautifully.

00:38:43.774 --> 00:38:45.504
Are you going somewhere?

00:38:55.354 --> 00:38:56.854
Thank you for everything.

00:38:58.425 --> 00:39:01.794
This time, I wanted...

00:39:02.325 --> 00:39:04.124
to say my final goodbye to you in person.

00:39:05.365 --> 00:39:08.164
What's with you? Why are you acting like I'll never see you again?

00:39:10.705 --> 00:39:12.004
Take care of your health.

00:39:13.675 --> 00:39:14.805
Especially your heart.

00:39:16.305 --> 00:39:19.874
And make sure you reconcile with your daughter.

00:39:21.374 --> 00:39:22.575
Later on...

00:39:24.644 --> 00:39:25.714
Many years later,

00:39:33.124 --> 00:39:34.854

00:39:36.995 --> 00:39:38.564

00:40:58.874 --> 00:41:00.615
Thanks to you, I was able to complete this song.

00:41:02.245 --> 00:41:03.684
Looking back, I realized...

00:41:04.385 --> 00:41:06.345
that this song wasn't the only thing you helped me complete.

you were always there with me.

You lied to me that you were my son.

But you know what?

00:41:32.274 --> 00:41:33.945
For some reason, I felt as though you were like my father.

00:41:35.544 --> 00:41:37.745
Even though I have never experienced a father's love,

00:41:39.184 --> 00:41:40.785
I got to experience something similar thanks to you.

00:41:44.455 --> 00:41:46.725
Son, thank you.

But...

00:41:50.894 --> 00:41:52.865
in my next life, I'll be born as your father.

Hey, Yi Chan!

00:42:00.075 --> 00:42:03.175
Don't make me set the table twice. Come out and eat now!

00:42:42.015 --> 00:42:43.144
Are you going back?

00:42:50.984 --> 00:42:52.484
I saw your reflection on the window...

00:42:54.455 --> 00:42:56.595
and the sad look on your face before bidding farewell.

00:42:59.024 --> 00:43:00.434
That was my Sherlock Holmes moment.

00:43:06.464 --> 00:43:07.504
I'm sorry.

Where are you going?

00:43:10.305 --> 00:43:12.245
Home? Abroad to study?

00:43:13.945 --> 00:43:15.075
Or the future?

00:43:16.984 --> 00:43:18.385
You said you were from the future.

I'm really sorry.

00:43:24.854 --> 00:43:26.385
I'm just curious.

00:43:28.124 --> 00:43:29.695
What happens to me in the future?

00:43:31.294 --> 00:43:32.495
Do I even go to college?

00:43:34.164 --> 00:43:35.834
What about the band? Do I keep playing?

00:43:38.635 --> 00:43:39.705
Will I...

00:43:42.905 --> 00:43:44.004
be able to hear then?

00:43:46.805 --> 00:43:48.845
Will I have stopped putting my grandma through a hard time...

00:43:50.845 --> 00:43:52.544
and become a good grandson,

Remember what I told you before?

00:44:08.995 --> 00:44:10.834
Your wife will love you.

00:44:12.765 --> 00:44:14.405
Your children will respect you.

00:44:16.274 --> 00:44:17.675
You will become an excellent father.

00:44:19.205 --> 00:44:20.345
That will be your future.

00:44:22.374 --> 00:44:24.285
Your weakness will make you unique.

00:44:25.214 --> 00:44:26.515
You will turn every hardship...

00:44:27.914 --> 00:44:29.484
into the story of a hero.

00:44:30.725 --> 00:44:33.024
- So... - What are you saying?

00:44:34.225 --> 00:44:35.924
I can't hear you at all.

00:44:35.925 --> 00:44:37.124
So...

00:44:47.305 --> 00:44:48.834
Keep your promise.

00:44:52.504 --> 00:44:54.075
Be strong and overcome this.

00:44:55.874 --> 00:44:57.544
Make sure to become my father.

00:45:04.225 --> 00:45:05.325
You listened to it.

00:45:19.205 --> 00:45:20.535
This isn't your fault.

00:45:21.905 --> 00:45:23.504
Accidents are just accidents.

00:45:25.075 --> 00:45:26.945
I will be miserable for some time now.

00:45:28.575 --> 00:45:30.814
But I won't be in despair, thinking my life is ruined.

00:45:32.584 --> 00:45:33.785
So go.

00:45:34.714 --> 00:45:36.155
Don't even look back, and leave.

00:45:37.325 --> 00:45:38.425
Go.

00:45:39.885 --> 00:45:41.825
When you can finally get rid of that guilty look on your face,

00:45:43.794 --> 00:45:45.164
come back to see me.

00:46:03.945 --> 00:46:05.444
(I have no doubt that you will come.)

00:46:05.445 --> 00:46:06.984
I have no doubt that you will come.

00:46:08.515 --> 00:46:10.083
I thought about waiting for you a little longer.

00:46:10.084 --> 00:46:12.055
But I have a long way ahead of you, so I'll get going first.

00:46:12.624 --> 00:46:15.394
See you after 28 years. Metaphor On.

00:46:30.874 --> 00:46:33.544
What? What's wrong with this?

00:46:37.515 --> 00:46:38.584
Gosh.

00:46:42.155 --> 00:46:43.785
Oh, no.

00:46:44.655 --> 00:46:45.825
Excuse me!

00:46:46.225 --> 00:46:48.655
Is anyone out here? I need help!

00:46:49.455 --> 00:46:53.064
Gosh. Please help me!

00:47:05.205 --> 00:47:08.845

(Used Books, The Day)

00:47:52.655 --> 00:47:54.155
I want my guitar back.

00:47:55.325 --> 00:47:56.695
I guess you want to change your life,

00:47:57.164 --> 00:47:59.725
not other people's lives this time.

00:48:00.464 --> 00:48:02.195
Drink this while I go and look for it.

00:48:02.265 --> 00:48:04.334
The lavender in the tea was harvested personally by me.

00:48:04.734 --> 00:48:06.765
It will help you calm down and sleep better.

00:48:10.274 --> 00:48:11.905
Here's a thing about life.

00:48:13.004 --> 00:48:14.874
It may not give you everything you want.

00:48:15.075 --> 00:48:18.785
But it does hide a small present for you from time to time.

00:48:20.115 --> 00:48:21.554
I hope you can endure...

00:48:21.555 --> 00:48:23.015
the cruel hardship life throws your way.

00:48:25.955 --> 00:48:29.124
So you can receive the present life has tucked away.

00:48:30.294 --> 00:48:31.464
To you...

00:48:31.925 --> 00:48:34.695
and everyone you wanted to protect,

00:48:35.495 --> 00:48:36.664
viva la Vida.

00:48:37.765 --> 00:48:39.104
Long live life.

00:48:54.814 --> 00:48:57.325
What is it? Was there a problem with the way I stored it?

00:48:58.785 --> 00:49:00.024
Who on earth are you?

00:49:01.225 --> 00:49:03.495
Even if I were to ask you that, you won't give me an answer.

00:49:06.865 --> 00:49:09.035
Just think of it as a joke from the deity.

00:49:10.664 --> 00:49:13.104
Life is filled with all kinds of metaphors.

00:49:13.564 --> 00:49:15.175
Interpretation is solely up to the receiver.

00:49:18.075 --> 00:49:19.445
There are no right answers.

00:49:22.475 --> 00:49:24.845
- I don't follow you. - Okay.

00:49:25.684 --> 00:49:27.144
But thanks for the tea.

00:49:39.995 --> 00:49:42.434
You're an artist. You should know what a metaphor is.

00:49:54.945 --> 00:49:58.515
When you find yourself in need of an answer, flip a coin.

00:50:04.885 --> 00:50:06.655
It was nice meeting you, kiddo.

00:50:24.245 --> 00:50:25.345
What happened?

00:50:27.445 --> 00:50:29.274
This is the guest room of the Jinsung family.

00:50:30.785 --> 00:50:31.814
Am I dreaming?

00:50:33.084 --> 00:50:34.184
Or is this real?

00:50:35.885 --> 00:50:38.524
What did he put in the lavender tea? Come on.

00:50:38.624 --> 00:50:40.825
- I'm sorry. I didn't get that. - Gosh, that startled me.

00:50:46.825 --> 00:50:48.234
What year is it now?

00:50:48.734 --> 00:50:50.604
It's 2023.

00:50:52.305 --> 00:50:53.865
Then did I come back to the present?

00:50:54.934 --> 00:50:56.575
Then why am I here?

00:51:08.084 --> 00:51:09.484
What do you mean you changed nothing?

00:51:10.925 --> 00:51:12.354
You rescued Chung Ah.

00:51:13.555 --> 00:51:14.854
Believe in Yi Chan.

00:51:15.894 --> 00:51:19.325
Yi Chan and Chung Ah exist in 2023 too.

00:51:20.064 --> 00:51:21.164
Eun Ho is there too.

00:51:22.734 --> 00:51:24.434
There are people who are waiting for you.

00:51:26.504 --> 00:51:27.774
And I live in that world too.

00:51:36.615 --> 00:51:37.814
(On Eun Yu)

00:51:39.184 --> 00:51:41.754
The number you dialled does not exist.

00:51:49.854 --> 00:51:51.064
Who are you?

00:51:52.294 --> 00:51:54.265
Did you get the wrong house?

00:51:56.334 --> 00:51:57.765
It was definitely this house.

00:51:59.664 --> 00:52:02.134
Do you know where the previous tenants moved?

00:52:02.135 --> 00:52:03.175
Nonsense.

00:52:03.274 --> 00:52:05.975
I built this house five years ago and moved in here.

00:52:06.544 --> 00:52:08.575
- There were no previous tenants. - Then...

00:52:20.854 --> 00:52:22.595
Eun Yu's history has changed.

00:52:23.955 --> 00:52:27.265
No way. Did she fail to come back from 1995?

(Jun Hyung of SPINE9)

00:52:33.805 --> 00:52:35.705
- Hey! - Where are you right now?

00:52:36.135 --> 00:52:38.044
Do you know how long I've been waiting for you at the salon?

00:52:38.345 --> 00:52:40.974
Forget it. I'm on my way to pick you up. Wait at your house.

00:52:40.975 --> 00:52:42.945
What? Hello?

00:52:47.044 --> 00:52:48.055
The salon?

00:52:49.115 --> 00:52:50.115
What salon?

00:52:51.225 --> 00:52:52.455
Excuse me.

00:52:53.455 --> 00:52:55.495
You're him, right? Ha Eun Gyeol of SPINE9?

00:52:55.825 --> 00:52:57.495
- It's him! This is awesome! - No way!

00:52:58.524 --> 00:52:59.595
Gosh. Take his pictures.

00:53:00.834 --> 00:53:01.865
Eun Gyeol.

00:53:02.135 --> 00:53:04.664
Can you give me a strand of your hair?

00:53:04.905 --> 00:53:06.064
My hair?

00:53:06.265 --> 00:53:08.004
- Two, please. - What?

00:53:08.434 --> 00:53:10.135
I just need two strands of your hair.

- Eun Gyeol! - Eun Gyeol!

00:53:14.544 --> 00:53:16.713
What's happening? Why are they following me?

00:53:16.714 --> 00:53:17.714
Am I famous or something?

00:53:18.015 --> 00:53:20.584
- Eun Gyeol! - Eun Gyeol!

00:53:22.084 --> 00:53:25.183
- Eun Gyeol! - Eun Gyeol!

- Eun Gyeol! - Eun Gyeol!

- Eun Gyeol! - Oh, no! He left!

00:53:38.664 --> 00:53:39.905

Are we going on a travel tour as a group?

00:54:00.325 --> 00:54:02.554
A travel tour, my foot.

00:54:02.555 --> 00:54:04.424
I'm talking about our tour abroad!

00:54:04.425 --> 00:54:05.495
Our tour abroad?

00:54:07.266 --> 00:54:10.034
We'll perform on stage as Yoon Dong Jin's support band.

00:54:10.035 --> 00:54:12.063
I told you to get permission from your parents for the tour.

00:54:12.064 --> 00:54:13.564
Did you just come back from your previous life or something?

00:54:13.765 --> 00:54:15.504
He's just sorry because he's late.

So let me get this straight.

00:54:45.035 --> 00:54:47.434
We're the artists of MJ Entertainment...

00:54:47.575 --> 00:54:49.434
and Jinsung Musical Instruments' endorsers as well.

00:54:49.575 --> 00:54:52.003
They're throwing a launch party for Goliath today.

00:54:52.004 --> 00:54:54.615
So we are going to perform at the party.

00:54:55.445 --> 00:54:57.945
I'm also the grandson of the Jinsung family?

00:54:58.414 --> 00:54:59.845
You're back to your senses, right?

00:55:00.084 --> 00:55:02.515

I had never...

00:55:30.745 --> 00:55:34.184
considered you my burden.

00:55:36.515 --> 00:55:37.515
Is that so?

00:55:38.385 --> 00:55:40.555
I considered you my burden many times, actually.

Don't forget that I let you play in the band...

00:57:47.785 --> 00:57:49.455
Have you been well?

00:57:50.684 --> 00:57:51.754
Was there a lot of traffic?

Just today?

00:58:03.394 --> 00:58:04.434
Just today.

Yi Chan was the one who cut all ties with his friend.

00:58:13.104 --> 00:58:15.314
When he saw his friends, his heart ached a bit...

00:58:15.975 --> 00:58:17.644
and he missed those days.

00:58:18.714 --> 00:58:20.543
Whenever they saw him, they seemed sad,

00:58:20.544 --> 00:58:22.155
and watching their sad faces was painful.

(Jinsung Musical Instruments)

00:59:54.274 --> 00:59:57.515
My initial dream was to become part of a cool band,

00:59:57.615 --> 00:59:58.914
dominate the world with our music,

01:00:00.644 --> 01:00:02.254
and win over the pretty girl.

01:00:07.254 --> 01:00:09.495
I had lost my hearing from an accident.

01:00:10.024 --> 01:00:12.624
So my dream was shattered to pieces back then.

01:00:17.765 --> 01:00:19.164
When I first lost my hearing,

01:00:20.964 --> 01:00:22.135
I was very scared.

01:00:31.515 --> 01:00:32.584
I was afraid.

01:00:33.885 --> 01:00:34.885
I was furious.

01:00:37.354 --> 01:00:38.655
Hopelessness swallowed me.

01:00:39.925 --> 01:00:43.725
So there was a time I couldn't talk at all.

01:01:07.885 --> 01:01:08.914
However,

01:01:10.055 --> 01:01:12.754
I gave up on giving up...

01:01:15.595 --> 01:01:18.164
because as I had lived 18 years of my life...

01:01:18.595 --> 01:01:20.495
in the world with sounds,

01:01:20.624 --> 01:01:22.464
so I was able to remember sounds.

01:01:23.464 --> 01:01:25.164
I was also able to imagine them.

01:01:26.504 --> 01:01:28.174
Afterwards, I had lived 28 years of my life...

01:01:28.175 --> 01:01:30.434
in the world without sounds.

01:01:30.535 --> 01:01:34.945
So I was certain that I'd be able to make the most beautiful...

01:01:35.314 --> 01:01:36.615
and sought-after sound.

01:01:40.115 --> 01:01:41.184
In the end,

01:01:42.354 --> 01:01:44.084
I had won over the pretty girl.

01:01:46.155 --> 01:01:47.624
- What? Come on. - Gosh.

01:01:49.955 --> 01:01:51.595
As for my dream of world domination,

01:01:52.265 --> 01:01:56.095
I believe that Goliath will achieve it in my place.

He did!

01:03:07.635 --> 01:03:09.833
Now, I will exit the stage...

Yes, sir. I'll get going.

01:03:50.274 --> 01:03:51.274
Okay.

01:04:05.894 --> 01:04:06.894
You saw it, right?

01:04:07.725 --> 01:04:08.834
I told you.

01:04:09.495 --> 01:04:11.604

Yes, don't stop, I can fly away

01:06:36.175 --> 01:06:41.314
Keep on knocking, and when the door opens,

01:06:41.515 --> 01:06:44.413
Then the story about the two of us

01:06:44.414 --> 01:06:47.083

Keep on knocking, and when the door opens,

01:07:23.455 --> 01:07:25.664
Don't you think we were slightly better than them?

01:07:25.825 --> 01:07:28.463
Right. And we looked better when we were younger.

01:07:28.464 --> 01:07:31.064
Yes. We should...

01:07:31.334 --> 01:07:33.635
- be really honest. - Yes.

01:07:33.865 --> 01:07:35.135
By the way,

don't you think Eun Gyeol looks like someone?

I feel like I can remember, but I can't. It's driving me crazy.

I thought you couldn't come back.

01:09:19.474 --> 01:09:22.715
Right. I almost couldn't come back.

01:09:22.945 --> 01:09:24.314
Why did you run away when you came?

01:09:24.715 --> 01:09:26.215
I didn't run away.

01:09:26.884 --> 01:09:27.945
I was fishing.

01:09:28.215 --> 01:09:29.684
So that I can be with you without anyone else.

01:09:30.854 --> 01:09:33.955
I guess it's a very nice bait. You took it so quickly.

Can anybody help me?

01:10:31.245 --> 01:10:32.285
Gosh.

01:10:33.814 --> 01:10:34.984
Excuse me.

01:10:44.255 --> 01:10:45.325
Do you want to get on?

01:10:52.734 --> 01:10:54.965
I made it.

01:10:55.905 --> 01:10:57.035
You're back.

01:10:57.274 --> 01:10:59.575
I mean, you told me to come.

01:10:59.905 --> 01:11:01.144
Can I drink this?

01:11:07.844 --> 01:11:09.054
I feel better now.

01:11:09.484 --> 01:11:11.254
Hearing that you feel better now,

01:11:11.255 --> 01:11:13.455
I guess you gave up on that creative suicide method.

01:11:14.585 --> 01:11:17.094
It's not because of you. So you don't have to feel proud.

01:11:18.524 --> 01:11:20.224
Oh, right. Master.

01:11:21.224 --> 01:11:22.495
Hurry up and just give my cello back.

I have questions for my dad too.

01:11:33.045 --> 01:11:34.905
And I promised to meet someone.

01:11:36.514 --> 01:11:38.274
Are you not going to give it to me? I don't have time.

01:11:43.814 --> 01:11:44.884
Here.

01:11:54.465 --> 01:11:57.535
Thank you for the travel, Grandpa.

01:11:59.064 --> 01:12:01.665
For the one-dollar bills you gave only to me.

01:12:01.905 --> 01:12:04.174
For letting me meet my mom who is the same age as me.

01:12:04.575 --> 01:12:07.575
For all the good friends I made. For everything.

01:12:11.314 --> 01:12:13.714
I'll be doing well with my mom when I go back.

So don't worry too much.

We'll keep arguing, though.

01:12:21.554 --> 01:12:24.354
I'll get going then.

01:12:25.365 --> 01:12:27.224
I'll live a good life there.
