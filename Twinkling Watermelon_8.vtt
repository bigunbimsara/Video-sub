You said you'd help me get into college...

00:01:15.005 --> 00:01:16.306
and that we should start a band together.

What's with you? Why are you being so clingy today?

00:02:26.115 --> 00:02:27.715
Where's Mom? Where is she?

00:02:28.145 --> 00:02:29.644
She's out with friends. She'll be home late.

00:02:29.645 --> 00:02:31.416
She said to go ahead and have dinner without her.

00:02:32.715 --> 00:02:33.786
What's for dinner?

00:02:34.456 --> 00:02:35.555
Ramyeon.

00:02:35.956 --> 00:02:38.095
Ramyeon? It'll be so good.

What's with him today?

00:02:46.666 --> 00:02:47.965
My gosh. It's so good.

00:02:50.835 --> 00:02:52.136
A dream? What kind of dream?

00:02:52.835 --> 00:02:55.905
In the dream, I travelled back to 1995...

00:02:56.145 --> 00:02:57.506
and met Dad.

00:02:58.375 --> 00:02:59.446
Did you say 1995?

00:03:01.016 --> 00:03:03.546
I was 18 back then.

00:03:04.115 --> 00:03:06.055
That's right. The same age as I am now.

00:03:08.456 --> 00:03:10.726
Dad, I tutored you in the dream,

00:03:11.296 --> 00:03:12.525
and we started a band together.

00:03:12.756 --> 00:03:15.025
Oh, right. I went to Snail Guesthouse too.

00:03:15.395 --> 00:03:17.025
And I met Great-grandma there.

00:03:18.736 --> 00:03:20.395
What about me? You didn't see me in your dream?

00:03:21.905 --> 00:03:24.106
Hey, it was way before you were born.

00:03:27.375 --> 00:03:29.546
So what did you think of me when you met me in your dream?

00:03:31.315 --> 00:03:32.416
I was super cool, right?

00:03:33.946 --> 00:03:35.085
Please. Give me a break.

00:03:35.886 --> 00:03:38.555
Dad, do you even know what I went through because of you?

00:03:39.786 --> 00:03:41.325
You never studied.

00:03:41.326 --> 00:03:43.585
- Stop, wait! - You always worried your grandma.

00:03:44.826 --> 00:03:46.755
- Se Gyeong. - You said Mom was your first love.

00:03:46.756 --> 00:03:47.825
Where have you been?

00:03:47.826 --> 00:03:49.965
- But you were chasing another girl. - I looked everywhere for you.

00:03:50.125 --> 00:03:51.565
What? Another girl?

00:03:51.796 --> 00:03:52.935
Are you serious?

00:03:53.136 --> 00:03:54.736
If Mom finds out, she'll be upset.

00:03:55.666 --> 00:03:58.205
No, that's not true. Your mom has always been the only one for me.

00:03:58.206 --> 00:04:00.275
Your mom was my first love.

00:04:02.546 --> 00:04:03.706
Oh, that must be Mom.

00:04:04.815 --> 00:04:06.775
I should ask Mom directly.

00:04:07.345 --> 00:04:08.945
No, don't do that.

00:04:08.946 --> 00:04:10.386
I will. I'll tell her everything.

00:04:12.715 --> 00:04:13.715
Mom!

00:04:19.525 --> 00:04:20.895
Everyone's here.

00:04:21.365 --> 00:04:22.865
Have you guys had dinner yet?

00:04:24.166 --> 00:04:25.595
If you go back now,

00:04:25.835 --> 00:04:28.205
your 2023 will look very different...

00:04:28.206 --> 00:04:30.236
from the 2023 you came from.

00:04:30.635 --> 00:04:32.135
Do you still wish to go back?

00:04:35.276 --> 00:04:36.375
I don't believe this.

00:04:37.075 --> 00:04:39.476
What's wrong, Eun Gyeol? Are you not feeling well?

00:04:40.646 --> 00:04:42.916
Oh, no. I guess you didn't know.

00:04:43.586 --> 00:04:46.014
The moment you arrived here,

00:04:46.015 --> 00:04:48.356
everything started to change.

00:04:48.856 --> 00:04:50.426
- Eun Gyeol. - No.

00:04:50.786 --> 00:04:51.955
What's wrong, sweetheart?

00:04:52.255 --> 00:04:53.355
It's me, your mom.

00:04:53.356 --> 00:04:55.526
No. This can't be happening!

00:05:01.836 --> 00:05:04.005
What is this? What happened?

00:05:04.736 --> 00:05:06.005

Chairman Yoon Gun Hyung of Jinsung Musical Instruments?

00:06:08.166 --> 00:06:09.935
Take this. You'll catch a cold.

00:06:18.615 --> 00:06:20.146
Isn't she the girl from that day?

00:06:20.375 --> 00:06:22.515
Don't tell me you're about to run away.

00:06:39.365 --> 00:06:42.365
That's odd. He wouldn't be late without a heads-up.

00:06:48.875 --> 00:06:50.906
Please leave a message after the tone.

00:06:53.515 --> 00:06:56.115
Yi Chan, it's me. I can't reach you.

00:06:56.445 --> 00:06:59.515
I'm going to head home now. Call me at home when you get this.

00:08:31.916 --> 00:08:34.514
It's you. I nearly bumped into you earlier.

00:08:34.515 --> 00:08:36.285
- Se Gyeong? - Oh, no.

00:08:36.286 --> 00:08:37.916
Are you all right? Are you hurt?

00:08:39.885 --> 00:08:40.885
That's blood.

00:08:41.825 --> 00:08:44.726
Did you get hurt when I bumped into you earlier?

00:08:45.955 --> 00:08:46.955
My gosh.

00:08:47.796 --> 00:08:50.595
Hey, wait! Where are you going?

00:08:52.036 --> 00:08:54.265
Why are you dragging me to a dark alley?

00:08:54.266 --> 00:08:55.305
Wait!

00:08:56.536 --> 00:08:58.074
Chung Ah? "Yoon Chung Ah?"

00:08:58.075 --> 00:09:00.935
Hey, Chung Ah. Let's talk first.

00:09:01.276 --> 00:09:02.574
Hey, where are you taking me?

00:09:02.575 --> 00:09:04.746
Hey! Violence is bad.

00:09:09.715 --> 00:09:10.746
Is that Yi Chan?

00:09:14.616 --> 00:09:17.026
Yi Chan! What happened?

00:09:17.585 --> 00:09:18.955
Help!

00:09:19.026 --> 00:09:21.564
Someone has collapsed. Anybody there?

00:09:21.565 --> 00:09:22.796
What's wrong?

00:09:23.166 --> 00:09:24.425
Can you please call 911?

00:09:24.426 --> 00:09:25.464
Someone has collapsed.

00:09:25.465 --> 00:09:27.195
Okay, I'll call them now!

00:09:29.666 --> 00:09:32.876
Yi Chan, Ha Yi Chan. Wake up.

00:09:33.036 --> 00:09:34.705
Open your eyes. Yi Chan!

Se Gyeong.

00:09:38.876 --> 00:09:40.516
Stop shaking me like that.

00:09:41.146 --> 00:09:43.685
My head hurts so much. It's killing me.

00:09:43.815 --> 00:09:46.016
What? You woke up.

00:09:46.355 --> 00:09:48.126
Do you recognize me?

00:09:50.126 --> 00:09:51.325
Hey, what happened?

00:09:52.156 --> 00:09:53.225
Can you get up?

00:09:54.766 --> 00:09:56.666
- Help me up. - Okay.

00:09:58.136 --> 00:09:59.396
Who are you, really?

00:10:00.935 --> 00:10:04.205
I tried to find out...

00:10:04.305 --> 00:10:06.335
but couldn't find anything on you.

00:10:06.376 --> 00:10:07.536
Who are you?

00:10:09.006 --> 00:10:10.944
Not a single belonging,

00:10:10.945 --> 00:10:12.215
let alone an ID card.

00:10:12.815 --> 00:10:14.315
Oh, my bag.

00:10:21.825 --> 00:10:23.985
You weren't there to participate in the audition.

00:10:26.225 --> 00:10:27.854
Let me explain what happened.

00:10:27.855 --> 00:10:30.094
I had a bit of a situation, so I went to the audition...

00:10:30.095 --> 00:10:31.765
and found an invitation someone had dropped.

00:10:31.766 --> 00:10:33.064
But the staff saw that and assumed...

00:10:33.065 --> 00:10:34.795
I was there to participate in the audition.

00:10:34.796 --> 00:10:36.435
- Are you a spy? - Pardon me?

00:10:36.766 --> 00:10:38.835
I bet you're a spy one of our competitors sent.

00:10:39.935 --> 00:10:41.305
Or are you a flopper?

00:10:41.575 --> 00:10:42.646
If not that,

00:10:42.975 --> 00:10:45.616
are you a blackmailer or something?

00:10:46.315 --> 00:10:49.616
You seem totally uninterested in listening to me or believing me,

00:10:49.845 --> 00:10:51.314
so think whatever you want.

00:10:51.315 --> 00:10:52.656
I'll be off, then.

00:10:53.016 --> 00:10:54.156
Where are you going? Sit down.

00:10:54.685 --> 00:10:55.756
Sit back down!

00:10:58.355 --> 00:11:01.324
I can't let you go like this after spending all that money...

00:11:01.325 --> 00:11:02.626
and manpower to sneak you out.

00:11:03.195 --> 00:11:05.166
Do you think I brought you here because I like you?

00:11:05.766 --> 00:11:07.865
Reporters are camping out in front of the hospital because of you,

00:11:07.866 --> 00:11:10.235
and the company's public image is about to go down the drain.

00:11:10.536 --> 00:11:12.136
I have no idea what you're saying now.

00:11:12.276 --> 00:11:13.905
I have to go. I have an urgent matter to attend to.

00:11:13.906 --> 00:11:15.075
If you want to leave...

00:11:20.016 --> 00:11:21.416
You'll have to sign this written pledge.

00:11:22.445 --> 00:11:24.814
A written pledge? About what?

00:11:24.815 --> 00:11:26.214
I'm the victim. Why should I...

00:11:26.215 --> 00:11:29.626
Look at this. You're already calling yourself a victim.

00:11:30.855 --> 00:11:32.095
My gosh.

00:11:32.426 --> 00:11:34.854
You'll leave like this with your innocent-looking doe eyes...

00:11:34.855 --> 00:11:36.126
only to spread false rumours.

00:11:36.225 --> 00:11:38.536
In the end, you'll do a 180 and come at us aggressively...

00:11:38.866 --> 00:11:40.095
for settlement money.

00:11:45.435 --> 00:11:46.835

00:11:52.715 --> 00:11:53.715
Are we good now?

00:11:56.685 --> 00:11:58.616
- Make sure you get this notarized. - Yes, sir.

00:12:10.225 --> 00:12:11.396
Oh, aren't you that girl from...

00:12:14.335 --> 00:12:15.406
I'm sorry.

00:12:22.805 --> 00:12:24.046
"Yoon Chung Ah."

00:12:25.146 --> 00:12:26.215
"Yoon Chung Ah?"

00:12:29.146 --> 00:12:30.215
It's Mom.

00:12:31.215 --> 00:12:32.256
Mom!

00:12:32.985 --> 00:12:34.585
Mom! It's me, Eun Gyeol!

00:12:34.756 --> 00:12:36.685
Let go of me. There's something I must check.

00:12:36.926 --> 00:12:38.296
Hey, let go!

00:12:39.896 --> 00:12:40.896
Stop right there.

00:12:43.126 --> 00:12:44.325
Let go!

00:12:44.396 --> 00:12:45.666
Let go of me!

00:12:45.796 --> 00:12:47.666
Mom!

00:12:47.996 --> 00:12:49.305
What's all the fuss about?

00:12:52.036 --> 00:12:54.704
Sir, this boy here keeps calling Miss Chung Ah "Mom."

00:12:54.705 --> 00:12:56.705
He said he needed to check something.

00:12:56.876 --> 00:12:58.075
That crazy idiot.

00:12:58.445 --> 00:13:00.475
I'm done negotiating with him, so drag him out at once.

00:13:05.156 --> 00:13:06.156
Are you out of your mind?

00:13:06.416 --> 00:13:08.525
Our deal is now null and void. I refuse to leave this place.

00:13:08.526 --> 00:13:10.525
- Hey! - You'd better not kick me out.

00:13:10.526 --> 00:13:12.255
If you do, I'll go straight to the office.

00:13:12.256 --> 00:13:14.655
I'll meet with the chairman and take it up with him.

00:13:14.656 --> 00:13:15.766
You little piece of...

00:13:19.036 --> 00:13:21.496
Hey, get up.

00:13:22.766 --> 00:13:25.036
Stop putting on an act. Get up, you punk!

00:13:26.636 --> 00:13:28.105
Hey.

00:13:29.146 --> 00:13:31.546
Hey!

00:13:49.565 --> 00:13:52.396
Earlier, I clearly heard them calling Mom "Miss Chung Ah."

00:13:52.796 --> 00:13:54.296
That means...

00:13:54.796 --> 00:13:56.335
this is where Mom and her family live.

00:13:56.666 --> 00:13:58.705
Chairman Yoon Gun Hyung is my maternal grandfather,

00:13:59.036 --> 00:14:02.705
and that obnoxious scumbag is my uncle?

00:14:03.006 --> 00:14:04.075
That's strange.

00:14:05.075 --> 00:14:07.575
I clearly remember Mom telling me that she had no family.

00:14:09.445 --> 00:14:10.445
Why?

00:14:11.445 --> 00:14:12.786
Why did she say that?

00:14:17.955 --> 00:14:19.425
Bring us something cold to drink.

00:14:19.426 --> 00:14:20.496
Yes, ma'am.

00:14:22.565 --> 00:14:23.926
Oh, boy.

00:14:27.695 --> 00:14:28.735
You're back.

00:14:29.935 --> 00:14:31.135
You're back, ma'am.

00:14:31.136 --> 00:14:34.005
What? Hey, Mom doesn't really like it...

00:14:34.006 --> 00:14:36.475
when she sees you with Attorney Jung.

00:14:38.146 --> 00:14:39.646
Go to your room, Sang A.

00:14:39.876 --> 00:14:40.945
Yes, ma'am.

00:14:48.355 --> 00:14:51.286
You. What did you do this time?

00:14:53.555 --> 00:14:55.095
Mom, the thing is...

00:14:55.666 --> 00:14:57.865
It's about the boy who had an electric shock the other day.

00:14:57.866 --> 00:15:00.996
I told you to watch your conduct until Mr. Chairman comes home!

00:15:13.975 --> 00:15:16.416
Hey, seriously. Get your face out of my sight!

00:15:18.085 --> 00:15:19.815
Goodness. I'm not even surprised anymore.

00:15:21.825 --> 00:15:23.455
Did you get into another fight?

00:15:27.825 --> 00:15:28.926
What is this?

00:15:33.636 --> 00:15:34.896
What's with this reaction?

00:15:35.766 --> 00:15:37.065
Something's fishy.

00:15:38.935 --> 00:15:40.176
Hey, did you steal this?

00:15:41.075 --> 00:15:42.646
Is that why there's blood all over this?

00:15:45.546 --> 00:15:46.746
Is this a limited edition?

00:15:48.215 --> 00:15:50.146
Anyway, thanks for this. I'll put this to good use.

00:15:53.756 --> 00:15:57.026
Hey! It hurts! Let go!

00:15:59.526 --> 00:16:00.756
Hey!

00:16:02.026 --> 00:16:03.126
Stay here.

00:16:03.225 --> 00:16:05.594
But I just heard a scream.

00:16:05.595 --> 00:16:06.834
Pretend you heard nothing.

00:16:06.835 --> 00:16:07.965
Pretend you're not here.

00:16:08.396 --> 00:16:10.036
For your own sake, that is.

00:16:20.376 --> 00:16:21.416
Hey!

00:16:25.815 --> 00:16:26.886
My hair.

00:16:28.416 --> 00:16:30.055
My hair!

00:16:32.095 --> 00:16:33.694
I'll pull your hair out too.

00:16:33.695 --> 00:16:35.496
I'll make you look like a featherless chicken.

00:16:35.996 --> 00:16:38.564
Let go! You'd better let go of me. Let go!

00:16:38.565 --> 00:16:40.036
Stop at once!

00:16:41.136 --> 00:16:42.435
What are you two doing right now?

00:16:42.935 --> 00:16:44.435
Mom.

00:16:44.805 --> 00:16:47.435
You see, Chung Ah...

00:16:47.605 --> 00:16:50.276
took my key ring from me.

00:16:50.345 --> 00:16:52.574
I asked her to give it back,

00:16:52.575 --> 00:16:55.074
but she grabbed me by the hair...

00:16:55.075 --> 00:16:56.945
and insisted that it was hers.

00:16:57.046 --> 00:17:01.786
Se Gyeong brought it for me from Europe as a gift.

00:17:07.426 --> 00:17:08.455
Hand it over.

00:17:23.505 --> 00:17:24.646
Shut your mouth.

00:17:26.146 --> 00:17:27.176
I told you to shut it.

00:17:30.846 --> 00:17:32.056
What are you, a lowly brute?

00:17:32.356 --> 00:17:34.215
If you're human, speak like one.

00:17:36.156 --> 00:17:38.025
- Mom? - Shut your mouth.

00:17:38.156 --> 00:17:39.295
It's Mom.

00:17:42.666 --> 00:17:44.525
Do I have to repeat the warning?

00:17:44.866 --> 00:17:46.566
What do you people do?

00:17:47.136 --> 00:17:49.136
Do you skin people alive and make musical instruments with it?

00:17:49.735 --> 00:17:51.366
I must check, so step aside.

00:18:00.376 --> 00:18:02.215
Do I have to tie you up to make you behave yourself?

00:18:02.586 --> 00:18:04.785
Must I lock you up to make you listen to me?

00:18:20.495 --> 00:18:21.535
Those eyes.

00:18:22.566 --> 00:18:24.735
I told you not to glare at me like that.

00:18:30.676 --> 00:18:32.545
What are you doing now?

00:18:47.995 --> 00:18:51.066
Weren't you told to stay in the guest room?

00:18:52.066 --> 00:18:53.234
Did you not tell him?

00:18:53.235 --> 00:18:55.166
We couldn't stop him. He was being stubborn, ma'am.

00:19:00.176 --> 00:19:01.176
Are you all right?

00:19:01.836 --> 00:19:03.146
Aren't you hurt?

00:19:04.445 --> 00:19:05.445
Sign language?

00:19:06.116 --> 00:19:07.416
What are you doing now?

00:19:08.015 --> 00:19:09.715
You're not allowed to use sign language in this house.

00:19:09.886 --> 00:19:11.846
What kind of nonsense is that?

00:19:12.856 --> 00:19:14.685
She's deaf. If she's not allowed to use sign language,

00:19:15.656 --> 00:19:18.225
then how on earth is she supposed to express herself?

00:19:23.426 --> 00:19:24.795
Tell me what's going on.

00:19:27.495 --> 00:19:29.636
You can tell me everything, Mom.

00:19:34.076 --> 00:19:35.106
"Mom?"

00:19:36.245 --> 00:19:38.205
You must've been taken aback by all the fuss.

00:19:39.215 --> 00:19:41.576
I was simply trying to discipline her as her mother.

00:19:42.616 --> 00:19:45.115
Instead of meddling in our family matters, pretend you didn't see...

00:19:45.116 --> 00:19:47.685
"Discipline?" Did you say you were trying to discipline her?

00:19:49.725 --> 00:19:52.055
What I saw today was clearly violence.

00:19:52.056 --> 00:19:53.096
Hey.

00:19:54.525 --> 00:19:56.965
Can't you see this? And my hair!

00:19:57.596 --> 00:19:59.735
That thing bit her and pulled my hair out.

00:19:59.935 --> 00:20:01.566
- "That thing?" - That's right.

00:20:03.306 --> 00:20:05.735
I asked you politely, but you aren't listening.

00:20:06.676 --> 00:20:09.705
Then I have no choice but to be rude.

00:20:10.576 --> 00:20:12.346
What are you waiting for? Drag him out at once.

00:20:15.715 --> 00:20:18.215
Let go. I told you to let go!

00:20:18.955 --> 00:20:20.056
Does the chairman know?

00:20:20.715 --> 00:20:22.755
Does he know what's going on in this house...

00:20:23.185 --> 00:20:25.524
and how your daughter is being treated?

00:20:25.525 --> 00:20:26.724
Does the chairman know?

00:20:26.725 --> 00:20:28.454
Shut his mouth at once!

00:20:28.455 --> 00:20:29.765
I'll tell everyone.

00:20:29.896 --> 00:20:31.795
Everything I saw and heard here.

00:20:31.896 --> 00:20:34.135
I'll tell the whole world!

00:20:34.136 --> 00:20:35.705
Let me hear it first.

00:20:38.876 --> 00:20:40.676
- Mr. Chairman. - Dad.

00:20:42.035 --> 00:20:43.106
Father.

00:20:44.475 --> 00:20:46.475
Weren't you supposed to return the day after tomorrow?

00:20:47.416 --> 00:20:49.014
If your schedule changed,

00:20:49.015 --> 00:20:51.346
why didn't you tell me?

00:20:55.826 --> 00:20:57.386
Are you Chairman Yoon Gun Hyung?

00:20:58.955 --> 00:21:00.254
You must be the unlucky guest...

00:21:00.255 --> 00:21:02.465
who had the accident because of my son.

00:21:03.666 --> 00:21:06.035
Let's hear it. Since it concerns my family,

00:21:06.995 --> 00:21:10.005
I should hear it before everyone else finds out.

00:21:13.906 --> 00:21:16.076
(Yeonnam Hospital)

00:21:27.816 --> 00:21:31.156
(Audiology Room)

00:21:33.596 --> 00:21:35.455
What did they say? Nothing's wrong with you?

00:21:37.896 --> 00:21:38.935
That's right.

00:21:39.235 --> 00:21:40.695
My hearing is as good as that of Jaime Sommers, the Bionic Woman.

00:21:41.366 --> 00:21:43.836
What about your head? Did they take an X-ray of your head too?

00:21:44.306 --> 00:21:46.735
Yes, it's totally fine. There isn't a single hairline fracture.

00:21:47.106 --> 00:21:48.475
I can go home tomorrow, as planned.

00:21:49.005 --> 00:21:50.106
Hey, Ma Joo. Applause.

00:21:52.646 --> 00:21:54.316
Hey, did you lie then?

00:21:54.616 --> 00:21:56.646
What the... Why would I lie about something like that?

00:21:57.045 --> 00:21:59.955
I swear. I heard a whooshing sound in my ear...

00:22:00.185 --> 00:22:02.685
and felt as though some alien was trying to talk to me.

00:22:04.056 --> 00:22:05.455
What do you even know?

00:22:09.066 --> 00:22:10.126
Oh, right.

00:22:10.396 --> 00:22:12.596
- Did you take care of that thing? - Yes.

00:22:13.235 --> 00:22:16.105
Bal San will be here as your guardian for your discharge,

00:22:16.106 --> 00:22:18.165
and he called the school saying he's your cousin.

00:22:18.166 --> 00:22:20.735
I see. Nice. He's very useful.

00:22:22.035 --> 00:22:25.306
Oh, give my thanks to your father.

00:22:26.146 --> 00:22:29.346
As for the hospital bill, tell him that I'll be sure to pay him back.

00:22:29.715 --> 00:22:30.785
Don't worry about it.

00:22:31.045 --> 00:22:33.014
You always help us carry stuff at our fabric store.

00:22:33.015 --> 00:22:34.015
Dad said not to worry.

00:22:34.016 --> 00:22:35.926
Oh, Grandma!

00:22:37.326 --> 00:22:38.556
Don't run. Be careful.

00:22:39.326 --> 00:22:40.755
Where are you going? The restroom?

00:22:41.326 --> 00:22:43.764
You should've told me. I would've come to get you.

00:22:43.765 --> 00:22:44.765
That's all right.

00:22:45.295 --> 00:22:46.695
Did you watch the drama yesterday?

00:22:47.035 --> 00:22:48.465
I did, of course.

00:22:48.535 --> 00:22:49.835
See? What did I tell you?

00:22:49.836 --> 00:22:51.735
I told you that they must be siblings.

00:22:51.836 --> 00:22:54.075
Yes, I know. What's going to happen now?

00:22:54.076 --> 00:22:55.535
It's okay.

00:22:55.745 --> 00:22:56.846
It'll be revealed...

00:22:57.376 --> 00:22:59.775
that they aren't blood-related, so they'll end up together.

00:23:00.076 --> 00:23:01.315
- Really? - Yes.

00:23:01.316 --> 00:23:02.985
My gosh. What a relief.

00:23:03.086 --> 00:23:06.684
So go ahead and use the restroom. Take your time.

00:23:06.685 --> 00:23:08.484
- My, he makes friends so easily. - Wait here.

00:23:08.485 --> 00:23:10.254
Okay. Don't you worry.

00:23:10.255 --> 00:23:11.555
People would think he's a long-term patient here.

00:23:11.556 --> 00:23:14.056
Hey! Come here.

00:23:15.255 --> 00:23:16.565
Is running allowed inside the hospital or not?

00:23:16.566 --> 00:23:18.165
It is not allowed, Captain!

00:23:18.166 --> 00:23:19.695
Good. Salute!

00:23:20.836 --> 00:23:22.195
- At ease! - Yes, sir.

00:23:22.906 --> 00:23:24.735
Yi Seul, what happened to your hair?

00:23:25.505 --> 00:23:27.576
I'll braid your hair for you later.

00:23:27.636 --> 00:23:29.105
Come to my room after dinner.

00:23:29.106 --> 00:23:31.445
- Okay, my hairstylist! - Okay, my princess!

00:23:34.646 --> 00:23:36.684
So you've joined the military and opened a hair salon.

00:23:36.685 --> 00:23:37.715
I see that you've been very busy.

00:23:38.816 --> 00:23:39.985
That reminds me.

00:23:40.656 --> 00:23:41.886
You didn't tell my grandma, right?

00:23:42.215 --> 00:23:45.585
I did. She called me in the morning, so I told her everything.

00:23:45.586 --> 00:23:47.955
You little... Have you got a death wish?

00:23:48.795 --> 00:23:50.225
Hey, I was just kidding.

00:23:50.725 --> 00:23:52.596
I said you were staying with me for a few days to study all night.

00:23:53.235 --> 00:23:54.435
Good job, Cheetah.

00:23:56.106 --> 00:23:57.106
Now, run.

00:24:26.336 --> 00:24:28.235
Oh, are you going somewhere?

00:24:28.336 --> 00:24:29.935
Hey, good timing. I'm glad you're here.

00:24:30.106 --> 00:24:31.435
Hey, Bal San.

00:24:31.636 --> 00:24:34.435
You know where Ma Joo's father's fabric store is, right?

00:24:34.935 --> 00:24:37.044
Yes, it's in Dongdaemun.

00:24:37.045 --> 00:24:38.375
I went there a few times to get some fabric.

00:24:38.376 --> 00:24:39.444
- I see. - Why do you ask?

00:24:39.445 --> 00:24:41.676
You lead the way. I want to go to that store.

00:24:42.045 --> 00:24:43.445
What? Why?

00:24:43.545 --> 00:24:46.556
Yi Chan didn't come home last night.

00:24:47.086 --> 00:24:49.184
I heard he'd eat and sleep there for 3 to 4 days...

00:24:49.185 --> 00:24:51.255
to study for his exams.

00:24:51.886 --> 00:24:54.355
I can't just send my grandson there and pretend not to know about it.

00:24:54.356 --> 00:24:56.596
I want to thank Ma Joo's father,

00:24:56.695 --> 00:24:58.625
so I'm going to drop off some side dishes for them.

00:24:58.626 --> 00:25:00.666
Gosh, just leave it.

00:25:00.965 --> 00:25:02.336
Don't go.

00:25:02.535 --> 00:25:05.306
Besides, Ma Joo eats so much whenever he's here.

00:25:05.735 --> 00:25:08.636
They're always so busy handling customers and delivering orders.

00:25:08.806 --> 00:25:10.745
It'll be a hassle for them if you show up unannounced.

00:25:12.245 --> 00:25:13.774
You're hiding something from me, aren't you?

00:25:13.775 --> 00:25:15.475
Gosh, what are you talking about?

00:25:15.785 --> 00:25:16.916
You're falsely accusing me here.

00:25:17.386 --> 00:25:20.185
I had a bad dream.

00:25:20.386 --> 00:25:22.454
Whenever I see Yi Chan's late mother in my dream,

00:25:22.455 --> 00:25:24.156
he either falls ill or gets hurt.

00:25:24.485 --> 00:25:27.495
Anyway, something always happened to Yi Chan in the past.

00:25:28.556 --> 00:25:31.165
Why are you just standing around? I told you to lead the way.

00:25:31.166 --> 00:25:32.194
What are you, a totem pole?

00:25:32.195 --> 00:25:33.666
I can't go there looking like this.

00:25:34.096 --> 00:25:36.865
I should wash and style my hair.

00:25:36.866 --> 00:25:39.806
Goodness. Forget it. I'll just go there and look for the store.

00:25:40.306 --> 00:25:42.306
Wait, hold on.

00:25:42.406 --> 00:25:45.345
You can't find it on your own. The Dongdaemun Market is like a maze.

00:25:45.346 --> 00:25:46.916
Then lead the way.

00:25:47.646 --> 00:25:48.876
Stop complaining and just get going.

00:25:49.086 --> 00:25:50.315
Goodness. Go.

00:25:50.316 --> 00:25:51.485
(Snail Guesthouse)

00:25:55.755 --> 00:25:58.156
Gosh. Don't swing it back and forth like that.

00:25:58.326 --> 00:26:00.326
The side dishes inside will get all mixed up.

00:26:04.765 --> 00:26:07.495
Oh, no! What a waste.

00:26:07.666 --> 00:26:10.336
Gosh, you little weasel.

00:26:11.005 --> 00:26:12.234
I bet you did that on purpose.

00:26:12.235 --> 00:26:13.704
My gosh. What a waste.

00:26:13.705 --> 00:26:15.474
It wasn't intentional, Ms. Go.

00:26:15.475 --> 00:26:18.376
Oh, no. I wasted all this food. My goodness.

00:26:18.945 --> 00:26:20.475
- You fool. - I'm sorry.

00:26:20.576 --> 00:26:21.974
- Hey, Ha Yi Chan. - My gosh.

00:26:21.975 --> 00:26:24.285
- I did my best. - I kept telling you to be careful.

00:26:25.285 --> 00:26:27.284
- Have you eaten yet? - Yes, have you?

00:26:27.285 --> 00:26:28.386
- Hello. - Hello.

00:26:29.255 --> 00:26:30.586
See, Ma Joo?

00:26:30.856 --> 00:26:32.255
This world is a ruthless place.

00:26:33.126 --> 00:26:36.166
The others won't even visit their frontman who's in the hospital.

00:26:36.326 --> 00:26:38.765
My gosh. I told them you'd be going home tomorrow.

00:26:39.495 --> 00:26:40.765
They're so mean.

00:26:41.035 --> 00:26:42.965
- Hush. - Why?

00:26:58.146 --> 00:27:00.015
- What? - My gosh.

00:27:02.316 --> 00:27:03.826
(Missing Person, Ha Eun Gyeol)

00:27:06.426 --> 00:27:08.426
I put it up all over Mapo-Gu.

00:27:08.596 --> 00:27:11.366
I put it in the weekly bulletin at my church just in case.

00:27:11.525 --> 00:27:13.065
Why? I thought...

00:27:13.066 --> 00:27:14.895
you'd forever be with the guitarist full of the Holy Spirit.

00:27:14.896 --> 00:27:17.606
You said only Ha Eun Gyeol could be our guitarist.

00:27:20.275 --> 00:27:21.336
That's right.

00:27:21.975 --> 00:27:23.545
Guys, didn't Hyun Yul come with you?

00:27:24.505 --> 00:27:27.075
That jerk. He has to remain a traitor to the end, doesn't he?

00:27:27.076 --> 00:27:28.116
Hey, what are you doing?

00:27:28.576 --> 00:27:30.045
Didn't you hear him calling you a traitor?

00:27:30.816 --> 00:27:31.816
What?

00:27:34.086 --> 00:27:35.255
Darn, what happened to his face?

00:27:36.955 --> 00:27:39.156
I fought with a Jindo dog while putting up the poster.

00:27:46.195 --> 00:27:47.635
It was a good fight.

00:27:47.636 --> 00:27:49.635
My gosh. I'm so touched.

00:27:49.636 --> 00:27:50.735
What can we do?

00:27:50.935 --> 00:27:52.406
We should follow our frontman's wishes.

00:27:54.306 --> 00:27:55.306
Guys.

00:27:55.636 --> 00:27:56.845
- Don't. - Hey, don't.

00:27:56.846 --> 00:27:58.105
Honestly, I really appreciate...

00:27:58.106 --> 00:27:59.514
- Hey, I told you to stop. - Say no more.

00:27:59.515 --> 00:28:01.544
To thank you for proving your passionate friendship,

00:28:01.545 --> 00:28:02.615
I'll do my best to...

00:28:02.616 --> 00:28:04.115
Hey, will you please stop?

00:28:04.116 --> 00:28:05.415
I told you to stop.

00:28:05.416 --> 00:28:06.855
- I'll do my best... - Stop.

00:28:06.856 --> 00:28:08.284
Hey, don't hit me.

00:28:08.285 --> 00:28:10.484
- As always, I'll make sure... - Hey, it hurts. It's me!

00:28:10.485 --> 00:28:12.426
I'll show you!

00:28:13.656 --> 00:28:14.724
Who's the jerk that said...

00:28:14.725 --> 00:28:15.896
I got beaten up by a gang?

00:28:19.896 --> 00:28:21.396
Hey, it's okay.

00:28:21.535 --> 00:28:24.505
A little bit of embarrassment can become a lasting memory.

00:28:25.035 --> 00:28:26.035
My gosh.

00:28:26.836 --> 00:28:29.076
Do I really have to tell you this myself?

00:28:31.346 --> 00:28:32.376
The legend...

00:28:34.816 --> 00:28:36.086
of that intense 10-on-1 fight.

00:28:37.146 --> 00:28:38.715
(Missing Person, Ha Eun Gyeol)

00:28:46.955 --> 00:28:48.856
Would you take your filthy hands off it?

00:28:52.495 --> 00:28:54.566
Before I break your wrists, that is.

00:28:55.566 --> 00:28:56.606
A toothpick?

00:28:57.166 --> 00:28:58.406
Not a match?

00:29:09.215 --> 00:29:11.886
Hey, kid. You're still wet behind the ears. Got a death wish?

00:29:12.285 --> 00:29:14.755
Boys, teach him a lesson.

00:29:25.965 --> 00:29:27.465
Don't tell me they pulled out guns.

00:30:12.816 --> 00:30:14.316
If you mess with my loved ones,

00:30:16.086 --> 00:30:17.846
I will never forgive you, no matter who you are.

00:30:28.025 --> 00:30:29.025
That moment...

00:30:29.465 --> 00:30:31.926
Yi Chan!

00:30:34.836 --> 00:30:37.335
"Yi Chan, wake up!"

00:30:37.336 --> 00:30:39.405
"Open your eyes!"

00:30:39.406 --> 00:30:42.846
"I can't live without you. I'll die!"

00:30:45.146 --> 00:30:46.176
Why would I die?

00:30:47.545 --> 00:30:48.576
- Se Gyeong. - Se Gyeong.

00:30:50.846 --> 00:30:51.916
Hey, move.

00:30:52.285 --> 00:30:53.856
Come here, Se Gyeong. Sit here.

00:30:54.656 --> 00:30:55.856
Guys, she saved my life.

00:30:55.955 --> 00:30:58.685
The thing is, I wasn't the one who saved you that day.

00:31:00.156 --> 00:31:01.225
What?

00:31:02.225 --> 00:31:04.195
- It wasn't you? - That's right.

00:31:04.396 --> 00:31:05.495
I knew it.

00:31:05.626 --> 00:31:07.434
You went to such lengths to talk total nonsense.

00:31:07.435 --> 00:31:08.495
No.

00:31:08.735 --> 00:31:10.665
You brought me to the hospital that day.

00:31:10.666 --> 00:31:12.666
Yes, that's right. I did,

00:31:12.836 --> 00:31:14.075
but someone else found you first...

00:31:14.076 --> 00:31:15.974
and asked for my help.

00:31:15.975 --> 00:31:18.406
So strictly speaking, she saved your life.

00:31:18.545 --> 00:31:19.646
Who was that?

00:31:20.076 --> 00:31:21.816
She was a student at Seowon Arts High School.

00:31:22.015 --> 00:31:23.745
Her name was...

00:31:24.785 --> 00:31:25.945
- Yoon Chung Ah? - What?

00:31:26.685 --> 00:31:28.785
Yoon Chung Ah? Your friend, Yoon Chung Ah?

00:31:29.156 --> 00:31:31.325
What? Yoon Chung Ah is my friend?

00:31:31.326 --> 00:31:33.555
You gave her the concert ticket and the letter too.

00:31:33.556 --> 00:31:34.626
Aren't you two close?

00:31:34.695 --> 00:31:36.426
Yes! That's right.

00:31:36.495 --> 00:31:38.224
Of course, we're close.

00:31:38.225 --> 00:31:39.995
I was just curious what others might think of us.

00:31:40.265 --> 00:31:43.135
Right, I always wondered how you two became friends.

00:31:43.136 --> 00:31:44.964
Well, how should I put this?

00:31:44.965 --> 00:31:46.906
We have great conversations.

00:31:47.005 --> 00:31:48.775
What? You two have great conversations?

00:31:49.406 --> 00:31:51.004
I thought she couldn't hear.

00:31:51.005 --> 00:31:52.774
What? She can't hear?

00:31:52.775 --> 00:31:54.044
- What? - What?

00:31:54.045 --> 00:31:55.076
- What? - What?

00:31:56.076 --> 00:31:57.444
The visiting hours are now over,

00:31:57.445 --> 00:31:59.346
so everyone must leave the room except for the patient's guardian.

00:31:59.515 --> 00:32:00.556
- Okay. - Got it.

00:32:01.316 --> 00:32:02.386
Hey, pass me my cola.

00:32:06.455 --> 00:32:07.525
That's blood.

00:32:08.326 --> 00:32:11.326
Did you get hurt when I bumped into you earlier?

00:32:13.066 --> 00:32:14.566
Hey, wait!

00:32:14.965 --> 00:32:16.035
Where are you going?

00:32:17.306 --> 00:32:19.836
Why are you dragging me to a dark alley?

00:32:20.205 --> 00:32:23.306
That means she couldn't understand a word I said.

00:32:25.406 --> 00:32:28.215
Mom had a friend like that? I'm surprised.

00:32:30.045 --> 00:32:31.385
- Hey, Se Gyeong. - Yes?

00:32:31.386 --> 00:32:33.355
We're going to grab a bite to eat. Do you want to join us?

00:32:33.356 --> 00:32:34.856
Sure, sounds good. What do you feel like eating?

00:32:34.955 --> 00:32:37.126
What? Really? You'll come with us?

00:32:39.025 --> 00:32:40.625
- I just can't have spicy food. - Jjajangmyeon.

00:32:40.626 --> 00:32:43.294
- Is there anything you're craving? - I'm hungry, so you guys choose.

00:32:43.295 --> 00:32:44.464
- We'll pick something, then. - Okay.

00:32:44.465 --> 00:32:46.396
- How about jjajangmyeon? - What do you feel like eating?

00:32:47.636 --> 00:32:49.635
- Let's just have jjajangmyeon. - Jjajangmyeon?

00:32:49.636 --> 00:32:50.865
No, Jjajangmyeon is spicy.

00:32:50.866 --> 00:32:52.434
The one with chilli powder. I don't like it.

00:32:52.435 --> 00:32:54.175
- Let's have jjajangmyeon. - I don't like jjajangmyeon.

00:32:54.176 --> 00:32:55.235
Come on. Let's have jjajangmyeon.

00:32:55.636 --> 00:32:57.245
How about stir-fried sundae? It's so good.

00:32:57.676 --> 00:32:58.875
- Jjajangmyeon is better. - Agreed.

00:32:58.876 --> 00:33:00.415
- No, I don't agree. - Whatever. Jjajangmyeon, it is.

00:33:00.416 --> 00:33:01.445
How about pizza? I'll treat you guys.

00:33:03.015 --> 00:33:04.715
- Really? It's on you? - Se Gyeong, how about pizza?

00:33:05.045 --> 00:33:07.255
- What? - Se Gyeong, how about pizza?

00:33:07.416 --> 00:33:08.655
- Se Gyeong. - Se Gyeong!

00:33:08.656 --> 00:33:09.725
Where did she go?

00:33:10.755 --> 00:33:13.056
Dad, I'm sorry.

00:33:15.596 --> 00:33:17.126
I'm really sorry.

00:33:18.166 --> 00:33:20.595
I tried to set Mom up with another man.

00:33:20.596 --> 00:33:22.735
I must've been out of my mind for a moment. I'm sorry.

00:33:23.136 --> 00:33:24.166
I'm really sorry.

00:33:24.505 --> 00:33:25.566
Dr. On.

00:33:26.636 --> 00:33:29.234
Your car is a LeMans, right? With the plate number 9125.

00:33:29.235 --> 00:33:30.376
Yes, why do you ask?

00:33:31.106 --> 00:33:33.774
Why don't you give me your car keys? I'll go put your things...

00:33:33.775 --> 00:33:34.916
in your trunk.

00:33:35.775 --> 00:33:38.346
By the way, is your surgical site healing well, Ms. Jung?

00:33:38.545 --> 00:33:39.556
Pardon me?

00:33:39.816 --> 00:33:42.356
I underwent surgery? What do you mean?

00:33:42.685 --> 00:33:44.656
You're an angel who had your wings removed. Doesn't it hurt?

00:33:45.886 --> 00:33:47.555
My gosh. Dr. On, please.

00:33:47.556 --> 00:33:48.926
I got it. I'll take my time with it.

00:33:49.056 --> 00:33:50.926
Thank you for offering to help though.

00:33:51.566 --> 00:33:54.435
Anyway, the hospital will feel empty starting tomorrow.

00:33:54.896 --> 00:33:56.405
Once you become a specialist in the US,

00:33:56.406 --> 00:33:57.964
you have to come back and take us out for dinner.

00:33:57.965 --> 00:33:59.135
Yes, of course.

00:33:59.136 --> 00:34:00.836
Seriously, if you forget me...

00:34:02.376 --> 00:34:03.445
I'll be mad at you.

00:34:04.606 --> 00:34:06.245
- Promise you won't forget me. - Okay, I promise.

00:34:06.515 --> 00:34:07.575
- Gosh. - Promise.

00:34:07.576 --> 00:34:09.416
Actually, I'm not sorry at all.

00:34:09.685 --> 00:34:11.445
He's such a flirt.

00:34:11.985 --> 00:34:13.856
He was so flirty even when he was young.

00:34:14.886 --> 00:34:15.985
Gosh.

00:34:17.426 --> 00:34:19.425
I'm sorry, Dad. But you missed your lucky chance...

00:34:19.426 --> 00:34:22.795
to have a pretty daughter named On Eun Yu in the future.

00:34:22.996 --> 00:34:24.065
Why?

00:34:24.326 --> 00:34:26.636
Mom will marry someone else. That's why.

00:34:26.735 --> 00:34:29.165
I'll make it happen.

00:34:30.735 --> 00:34:32.465
Who's Mom's future husband?

00:34:33.076 --> 00:34:35.035
It's Ha Yi...

00:34:35.036 --> 00:34:36.406
Are you sure it's him?

00:34:38.145 --> 00:34:40.814
It's probably Ha Yi...

00:34:40.815 --> 00:34:41.815
Are you sure about that?

00:34:43.915 --> 00:34:46.215
Darn you, Master!

00:34:46.415 --> 00:34:48.786
Why do you keep confusing me like this?

00:34:49.625 --> 00:34:50.686
Darn it.

00:35:02.496 --> 00:35:03.866
If you go back now,

00:35:04.465 --> 00:35:06.905
your 2023 will look very different...

00:35:06.906 --> 00:35:09.005
from the 2023 you came from.

00:35:09.275 --> 00:35:10.806
Do you still wish to go back?

00:35:12.306 --> 00:35:13.315
Eun Gyeol.

00:35:14.076 --> 00:35:16.585
What's wrong, sweetheart? It's me, your mom.

00:35:16.945 --> 00:35:19.215
That was a dream. It was nothing more than a dream.

00:35:19.755 --> 00:35:21.556
That can never happen in real life.

00:35:22.556 --> 00:35:25.355
There must be a reason I woke up at Mom's place.

00:35:25.855 --> 00:35:27.556
I should call Master.

00:36:02.456 --> 00:36:03.496
(Call)

00:36:04.165 --> 00:36:06.495
The number does not exist.

00:36:06.496 --> 00:36:08.936
Check the number and dial again.

00:36:10.706 --> 00:36:11.766
Shoot.

00:36:17.875 --> 00:36:19.476
Why did you not pick up the phone?

00:36:19.545 --> 00:36:21.246
Why did you not pick up the phone?

00:36:21.746 --> 00:36:24.615
Stop confusing me and just say it.

00:36:24.616 --> 00:36:25.885
Then I'll just go for it.

00:36:25.886 --> 00:36:26.985
Is she a loan shark?

00:36:28.456 --> 00:36:31.286
Three days. I'll give you just three days.

00:36:31.625 --> 00:36:33.425
In three days, you either call me...

00:36:33.426 --> 00:36:36.156
or bring that person to me. You decide.

00:36:36.596 --> 00:36:39.365
Or I'll miraculously bend your back backward.

00:36:39.366 --> 00:36:40.366
Got it?

00:36:44.706 --> 00:36:46.735
- Perhaps... - Perhaps...

00:36:47.076 --> 00:36:48.275
- This could mean... - This could mean...

00:36:48.436 --> 00:36:50.575
Mom's first love might be Ha Eun Gyeol.

00:36:50.576 --> 00:36:52.846
Choi Se Gyeong might become my mom.

00:36:52.976 --> 00:36:54.715
- Is it fate? - Is it a warning?

00:36:56.485 --> 00:36:57.516
Eun Gyeol?

00:36:58.116 --> 00:36:59.855
- You're Eun Gyeol, right? - No, I'm not.

00:37:00.456 --> 00:37:02.854
What do you mean you're not? You're Eun Gyeol.

00:37:02.855 --> 00:37:04.786
Do you not know me? I'm Choi Se Gyeong.

00:37:07.695 --> 00:37:10.225
What's the matter, sweetie? It's me. Your mom.

00:37:10.226 --> 00:37:12.025
No. You're not.

00:37:12.195 --> 00:37:13.735
- I said you were not. - My goodness.

00:37:14.795 --> 00:37:16.636
What do you mean that I'm not?

00:37:16.835 --> 00:37:18.105
Give up, Missus.

00:37:18.406 --> 00:37:19.664
You can never be.

00:37:19.665 --> 00:37:22.076
"Missus?"

00:37:22.576 --> 00:37:24.605
Did you just call me "Missus?"

00:37:24.846 --> 00:37:27.246
I'm sorry, but I will never let that happen.

00:37:28.915 --> 00:37:30.084
No matter what it takes, I...

00:37:30.085 --> 00:37:32.186
I will destroy your relationship with Yi Chan.

00:37:34.186 --> 00:37:35.456
What? Hey.

00:37:35.985 --> 00:37:38.056
Let go of me when I'm being nice, Missus.

00:37:38.156 --> 00:37:40.325
Shut your mouth when I'm being nice, Mister.

00:37:40.326 --> 00:37:41.826
- Missus. - Mister.

00:37:42.596 --> 00:37:44.726
I'm not doing this because I like you.

00:37:44.926 --> 00:37:46.866
You're 200 times uglier than my dad.

00:37:47.895 --> 00:37:49.805
I just need to check something.

00:37:49.806 --> 00:37:51.306
So don't say anything and follow me.

00:37:51.665 --> 00:37:53.605
I'll be polite since you're older than me.

00:37:54.735 --> 00:37:55.906
Let go of me.

00:37:56.306 --> 00:37:57.806
I said, "Let go of me."

00:37:58.846 --> 00:38:02.145
You should know that I'm the one who is being polite.

00:38:02.346 --> 00:38:04.616
- Seriously. - Stop it, will you?

00:38:05.315 --> 00:38:06.686
Where are you going?

00:38:07.985 --> 00:38:09.255
Enjoy your meal.

00:38:09.755 --> 00:38:12.386
- What's this? - Why do you ask? It's jokbal.

00:38:12.886 --> 00:38:14.426
It looks amazing.

00:38:19.326 --> 00:38:21.165
Gosh, it smells so good.

00:38:22.695 --> 00:38:24.635
I followed you because you said you needed to check something.

00:38:24.636 --> 00:38:26.436
And you give me pig's trotters?

00:38:26.465 --> 00:38:28.406
How are you doing after running away?

00:38:28.476 --> 00:38:29.604
Have you been eating?

00:38:29.605 --> 00:38:31.444
It's not bad. I've been eating well.

00:38:31.445 --> 00:38:32.476
Are you done checking?

00:38:32.746 --> 00:38:33.815
Wait.

00:38:35.415 --> 00:38:36.545
Eat this before you go.

00:38:38.886 --> 00:38:41.516
Just have one bite at least. Please.

00:38:47.096 --> 00:38:50.395
Why should I eat this?

00:38:50.965 --> 00:38:53.866
Someone's life is at stake. Please do as I say.

00:39:13.116 --> 00:39:15.254
- Let me ask you something first. - My gosh.

00:39:15.255 --> 00:39:16.886
You can ask after eating.

00:39:16.985 --> 00:39:18.686
"Everything goes better on a full stomach." Don't you know it?

00:39:19.426 --> 00:39:22.155
Here. Open your mouth.

00:39:22.156 --> 00:39:23.425
My life is at stake.

00:39:23.426 --> 00:39:25.496
That's why I'm asking you to have a bite before then.

00:39:25.596 --> 00:39:27.536
Your answer will decide someone's... No.

00:39:28.096 --> 00:39:29.635
A whole family's fate.

00:39:29.636 --> 00:39:32.165
Why are you saying that in front of jokbal?

00:39:34.976 --> 00:39:36.036
Go on.

00:39:40.116 --> 00:39:42.346
You said you were not playing with Yi Chan's feelings.

00:39:43.215 --> 00:39:45.886
And you also said people can change their minds.

00:39:47.016 --> 00:39:48.386
The jokbal is getting cold.

00:39:48.855 --> 00:39:50.625
So what do you think of Yi Chan now?

00:39:52.556 --> 00:39:53.596
Do you like him?

00:39:54.596 --> 00:39:56.895
Hold on. I should be careful here.

00:39:57.366 --> 00:39:58.794
I'm not done checking yet.

00:39:58.795 --> 00:40:00.535
If I say I like Yi Chan,

00:40:00.536 --> 00:40:01.996
I might upset him for no reason.

00:40:03.706 --> 00:40:05.866
- I'll say, "No comment." - Then I won't eat either.

00:40:06.036 --> 00:40:07.834
What's your problem?

00:40:07.835 --> 00:40:09.635
We agreed to play fair.

00:40:09.636 --> 00:40:11.004
Then you should keep good manners.

00:40:11.005 --> 00:40:12.444
Answer me. I'll eat then.

00:40:12.445 --> 00:40:13.875
Eat. I'll answer then.

00:40:18.045 --> 00:40:19.215
Let's just stop.

00:40:19.886 --> 00:40:21.815
Oh, my goodness. He's so...

00:40:22.116 --> 00:40:24.686
Excuse me. Could you box this up for me?

00:40:25.186 --> 00:40:27.625
Eun Gyeol. Wait.

00:40:28.056 --> 00:40:29.996
Stop there for a moment.

00:40:31.125 --> 00:40:33.025
I got it. I'll let you go.

00:40:33.226 --> 00:40:34.635
I'll let you go.

00:40:34.636 --> 00:40:36.465
Just tell me where you're staying before you go.

00:40:36.665 --> 00:40:38.436
Why should I tell you that?

00:40:38.536 --> 00:40:40.435
Aren't you worried about people who are waiting for you?

00:40:40.436 --> 00:40:42.305
They need to know how you're doing at least.

00:40:42.306 --> 00:40:44.346
- Yi Chan has been looking for you. - I'm warning you.

00:40:44.945 --> 00:40:46.875
Don't you ever say his name in front of me.

00:40:47.346 --> 00:40:49.985
Gosh, is he a traitor or something?

00:40:50.145 --> 00:40:51.714
Did you catch him plotting treason?

00:40:51.715 --> 00:40:54.515
I have a place to stay. I've never skipped a meal.

00:40:54.516 --> 00:40:55.656
And I got a job.

00:40:55.815 --> 00:40:57.055
Most importantly,

00:40:57.056 --> 00:40:59.056
there's something I need to do and I should put my life on it.

00:40:59.156 --> 00:41:00.226
Are we done now?

00:41:01.395 --> 00:41:03.425
Why on earth are you being like this? Are you going through puberty?

00:41:03.426 --> 00:41:05.426
Are you unhappy because the Earth isn't moving as you want?

00:41:05.565 --> 00:41:08.465
What did Yi Chan do wrong for you to act like this?

00:41:15.536 --> 00:41:17.375
I think you're mistaken.

00:41:17.945 --> 00:41:21.215
I don't hate Yi Chan. I hate you who is beside him.

00:41:21.775 --> 00:41:23.145
I hate you.

00:41:26.445 --> 00:41:28.315
You shouldn't have pushed me to say this.

00:41:29.786 --> 00:41:31.056
I'm sorry, Missus.

00:41:31.656 --> 00:41:33.996
Please understand that I had no choice.

00:41:34.596 --> 00:41:37.665
When I go back to 2023, I'll pay for everything I did.

00:41:38.525 --> 00:41:39.625
Gosh.

00:41:40.335 --> 00:41:41.936
What kind of absurd situation is this?

00:41:42.835 --> 00:41:43.866
My goodness.

00:41:44.005 --> 00:41:46.335
Mom was treated like this by a man like him?

00:41:48.076 --> 00:41:49.306
I shouldn't be like this.

00:41:50.045 --> 00:41:51.976
If I feel offended, I'm losing. Darn it.

00:41:54.516 --> 00:41:56.616
It hurt my feelings.

00:41:57.746 --> 00:41:58.786
Gosh.

00:42:05.926 --> 00:42:07.556
Do you really have to do that?

00:42:08.726 --> 00:42:11.665
My grandma told me that I should thank people without putting it off.

00:42:12.165 --> 00:42:14.436
It's something I should do for my lifesaver as a human.

00:42:16.906 --> 00:42:18.005
But are you sure it's that house?

00:42:18.335 --> 00:42:19.965
- Yes, I'm sure. - Gosh.

00:42:20.436 --> 00:42:23.475
You climbed over the wall to see Se Gyeong and got humiliated.

00:42:23.476 --> 00:42:25.104
It's that house you got kicked out of as you ruined the party.

00:42:25.105 --> 00:42:26.475
The house of the chairwoman of Seowon Arts High School.

00:42:26.476 --> 00:42:29.016
- Gosh, it's a long address. - Yes.

00:42:29.315 --> 00:42:31.246
And you know what? It's the house of the Jinsung Family.

00:42:31.645 --> 00:42:35.015
It means Chung Ah is the daughter of a conglomerate.

00:42:35.016 --> 00:42:36.686
But don't be intimidated.

00:42:41.295 --> 00:42:42.326
Gosh.

00:42:46.766 --> 00:42:48.195
Intimidated, my foot.

00:43:01.275 --> 00:43:02.415
Who is it?

00:43:03.915 --> 00:43:06.615
Hello, I'm Ha Yi Chan in grade 11, class 3,

00:43:06.616 --> 00:43:08.556
in Baekwang High School.

00:43:08.815 --> 00:43:10.124
The reason why I came...

00:43:10.125 --> 00:43:13.255
is because I have something to say to Chung Ah.

00:43:13.496 --> 00:43:15.556
May I see her for a moment, please?

00:43:15.826 --> 00:43:17.226
Just give me a moment.

00:43:17.426 --> 00:43:18.465
Yes, ma'am.

00:43:19.996 --> 00:43:21.636
I'm not intimidated at all.

00:43:23.195 --> 00:43:24.306
Oh, right.

00:43:27.636 --> 00:43:28.636
"Thank you."

00:43:29.136 --> 00:43:30.176
"You..."

00:43:30.846 --> 00:43:33.076
"saved me."

00:43:35.476 --> 00:43:36.576
"I'm sorry."

00:43:36.815 --> 00:43:39.116
"I didn't know."

00:43:39.415 --> 00:43:41.516
- Hello. - Yes?

00:43:42.085 --> 00:43:44.156
She doesn't know you. She told you to leave.

00:43:45.025 --> 00:43:47.096
Sorry? It's impossible.

00:43:47.656 --> 00:43:49.194
Can you please talk to her again?

00:43:49.195 --> 00:43:51.996
She said she didn't know you. You should leave now.

00:43:52.025 --> 00:43:54.136
Wait.

00:43:55.266 --> 00:43:58.105
Ring the bell one more time. I'll call the police.

00:44:34.335 --> 00:44:35.605
There's a navigation system in your body.

00:44:35.976 --> 00:44:38.846
You know when you scratch your head while waiting for someone.

00:44:38.976 --> 00:44:41.914
If you scratch the back of your head, it means you should wait more.

00:44:41.915 --> 00:44:44.085
If you scratch the front of your head, you'll meet the person soon.

00:44:48.686 --> 00:44:49.686
Darn it.

00:45:10.306 --> 00:45:15.346
(Ha Yi Chan)

00:45:37.636 --> 00:45:38.906
I'm sorry for making you wait.

00:45:42.335 --> 00:45:44.176
Why don't we sit down?

00:46:06.295 --> 00:46:09.536
Is Yoon Chung Ah your biological daughter, sir?

00:46:16.505 --> 00:46:18.406
You saw, heard, and experienced...

00:46:18.775 --> 00:46:20.676
some things at my house.

00:46:21.476 --> 00:46:23.885
I'm having this meeting with you, so you can tell me...

00:46:23.886 --> 00:46:26.246
all about that before you tell the whole world.

00:46:27.456 --> 00:46:29.854
I thought you were going to spill everything,

00:46:29.855 --> 00:46:31.485
but you asked me a daring question instead.

00:46:33.485 --> 00:46:34.795
What's your angle?

00:46:35.426 --> 00:46:37.295
If she is indeed your biological daughter,

00:46:38.465 --> 00:46:40.395
why wouldn't you let her use sign language?

00:46:41.496 --> 00:46:42.536
No.

00:46:43.596 --> 00:46:46.406
Why didn't you teach her sign language from the start?

00:46:46.866 --> 00:46:47.936
Why didn't I?

00:46:49.005 --> 00:46:50.605
I have a simple reason for that.

00:46:51.406 --> 00:46:53.444
There's no need to make it obvious to everyone...

00:46:53.445 --> 00:46:55.445
that my daughter has a disability.

00:46:57.045 --> 00:46:59.145
Nor did I want anyone to know about her disability.

00:47:05.755 --> 00:47:07.056
Those are sad eyes.

00:47:07.855 --> 00:47:08.926
Why?

00:47:18.706 --> 00:47:21.306
The chairman talked to you, right?

00:47:23.076 --> 00:47:26.706
Starting today, I'll be tutoring you.

00:47:28.346 --> 00:47:31.016
Aren't you curious about what you'll be learning from me?

00:47:31.715 --> 00:47:32.945
He seems kind.

00:47:33.686 --> 00:47:34.715
Why?

00:47:35.456 --> 00:47:36.456
It's sign language.

00:47:37.625 --> 00:47:41.096
Sounds we make with our hands.

00:47:44.395 --> 00:47:46.826
It's what you taught me when I was a baby.

00:47:54.275 --> 00:47:55.335
He's crying.

00:47:56.605 --> 00:47:57.645
Why?

00:48:00.375 --> 00:48:01.445
But...

00:48:03.116 --> 00:48:06.045
it's a secret to other people.

00:48:07.215 --> 00:48:08.585
A secret that only you,

00:48:09.755 --> 00:48:11.485
the chairman, and I will know.

00:48:14.156 --> 00:48:16.826
Then let's begin.

00:48:18.665 --> 00:48:19.766
Come and sit down.

00:48:37.076 --> 00:48:39.786
First of all, let me introduce myself.

00:48:41.116 --> 00:48:42.215
My name is...

00:48:43.116 --> 00:48:44.855
Ha Eun Gyeol.

00:48:46.656 --> 00:48:47.726
Ha.

00:48:48.456 --> 00:48:49.496
Eun.

00:48:50.625 --> 00:48:51.695
Gyeol.

00:48:54.366 --> 00:48:55.596
"A clear sound."

00:48:58.036 --> 00:48:59.735
"Clear..."

00:50:08.735 --> 00:50:09.875
What's your name?

00:50:10.576 --> 00:50:11.846
It's Ha Eun Gyeol.

00:50:12.145 --> 00:50:13.275
Ha Eun Gyeol?

00:50:14.415 --> 00:50:15.945
You seem young. How old are you?

00:50:18.145 --> 00:50:19.215
I'm 18.

00:50:20.656 --> 00:50:22.584
Your parents must be very worried.

00:50:22.585 --> 00:50:23.814
Let's call your parents first.

00:50:23.815 --> 00:50:24.826
My parents...

00:50:26.686 --> 00:50:28.656
are in another world now.

00:50:32.996 --> 00:50:34.136
Does it mean you're an orphan?

00:50:35.996 --> 00:50:37.266
For now, sort of.

00:50:38.136 --> 00:50:39.136
Just for now.

00:50:39.406 --> 00:50:41.235
Are there any relatives or guardians you can call?

00:50:41.636 --> 00:50:42.676
There's no one.

00:50:45.275 --> 00:50:47.645
It sounds like you don't have a place to go.

00:50:50.915 --> 00:50:52.185
Until you recover your health,

00:50:52.186 --> 00:50:53.915
you should stay in the guest room.

00:50:54.386 --> 00:50:56.016
It was a natural disaster,

00:50:56.215 --> 00:50:59.125
but the accident took place at the event my company held.

00:50:59.556 --> 00:51:01.926
I will offer my generosity until you fully recover.

00:51:02.496 --> 00:51:05.695
Of course, I will provide you with proper monetary compensation.

00:51:06.795 --> 00:51:08.936
I would like to teach your daughter sign language.

00:51:10.866 --> 00:51:12.005
You want to do what?

00:51:12.465 --> 00:51:14.375
I don't need any other compensation.

00:51:14.835 --> 00:51:16.636
Let me teach her sign language just while I stay...

00:51:16.835 --> 00:51:17.944
in your guest room.

00:51:17.945 --> 00:51:20.205
Perhaps, you're mistaken that you're entitled to my generosity.

00:51:20.206 --> 00:51:22.746
I'm pleading with you for the happiness of your daughter.

00:51:23.846 --> 00:51:25.484
Look, kid.

00:51:25.485 --> 00:51:27.286
My parents were deaf too.

00:51:28.485 --> 00:51:30.255
Despite that, they were cheerful,

00:51:31.556 --> 00:51:32.625
healthy,

00:51:34.395 --> 00:51:35.855
and overly happy...

00:51:36.956 --> 00:51:37.996
because...

00:51:40.665 --> 00:51:42.036
they could communicate...

00:51:43.596 --> 00:51:46.235
with their eyes, their hearts,

00:51:47.206 --> 00:51:48.306
and their hands.

00:51:49.636 --> 00:51:51.544
Learning sign language will make her happy?

00:51:51.545 --> 00:51:52.545
What a strange argument.

00:51:52.546 --> 00:51:53.806
It's not strange.

00:51:54.875 --> 00:51:55.914
It doesn't matter what the intention is.

00:51:55.915 --> 00:51:57.714
Taking away the ability to speak...

00:51:57.715 --> 00:51:59.116
is the same as taking away their world.

00:51:59.145 --> 00:52:02.186
It's equivalent to colonizing someone's soul.

00:52:02.656 --> 00:52:04.485
You make sign language sound so grand.

00:52:04.786 --> 00:52:08.625
All right. What's the conclusion of this touching lecture?

00:52:12.195 --> 00:52:13.266
I want to give back...

00:52:14.965 --> 00:52:16.695
the world to your daughter.

00:52:18.436 --> 00:52:19.465
What?

00:52:19.605 --> 00:52:21.936
So she won't be lonely like an isolated island anymore.

00:52:23.406 --> 00:52:25.176
So she won't be discriminated for her difference.

00:52:27.645 --> 00:52:28.976
I want to build a bridge for her...

00:52:30.375 --> 00:52:31.415
at home...

00:52:32.715 --> 00:52:33.786
and...

00:52:43.426 --> 00:52:44.524
at her school too.

00:52:44.525 --> 00:52:46.195
(Ha Eun Gyeol)

00:52:47.226 --> 00:52:48.295
Ha Eun Gyeol.

00:52:48.636 --> 00:52:50.765
What you said to me left an imprint on my mind,

00:52:50.766 --> 00:52:52.335
so I stayed up all night. Darn it.

00:52:53.036 --> 00:52:55.576
So you're not going to cooperate?

00:52:56.076 --> 00:52:57.444
If he's not going to answer my question,

00:52:57.445 --> 00:52:59.445
I have no choice but to ask around to get my answer.

00:53:00.545 --> 00:53:02.645
That's not Yoon Chung Ah.

00:53:03.815 --> 00:53:05.545
That's not Yoon Chung Ah.

00:53:06.585 --> 00:53:08.515
If she's Mom's friend, she must know...

00:53:08.516 --> 00:53:10.685
the relationship between Mom and Ha Eun Gyeol...

00:53:10.686 --> 00:53:12.556
and who Mom's first love is.

00:53:13.786 --> 00:53:15.996
Not Yoon Chung Ah.

00:53:18.565 --> 00:53:19.596
What's up with that car?

00:53:24.266 --> 00:53:26.206
He looks just like Ha Eun Gyeol.

00:53:26.866 --> 00:53:28.375
Wait, no. That is Ha Eun Gyeol.

00:53:29.036 --> 00:53:30.306
What? That's Yoon Chung Ah.

00:53:31.145 --> 00:53:32.875
How come they're coming out of the same car?

00:53:33.976 --> 00:53:37.445
Anyway, I can kill 2 birds with 1 stone. It'll be 2 for 1.

00:53:37.516 --> 00:53:38.544
I should go and talk to them.

00:53:38.545 --> 00:53:39.585
Hey.

00:53:39.746 --> 00:53:41.116
Isn't that Yoon Chung Ah from Art Department, right?

00:53:41.186 --> 00:53:43.185
- Excuse me, girls. - Who's that new guy?

00:53:43.186 --> 00:53:44.325
- Let me walk you... - What? Who's that?

00:53:44.326 --> 00:53:46.055
- Let me pass through. - to your classroom.

00:53:46.056 --> 00:53:48.325
- Who's that? - What's going on?

00:53:48.326 --> 00:53:49.925
- Look at his face. - Excuse me.

00:53:49.926 --> 00:53:51.725
- Hey, he's going up. - Excuse me. Girls.

00:53:51.726 --> 00:53:53.325
- I haven't seen him around before. - What a surprise.

00:53:53.326 --> 00:53:55.164
- Right. I guess he goes here. - Gosh.

00:53:55.165 --> 00:53:56.165
This is crazy.

00:53:56.166 --> 00:53:57.906
Hey, Yoon Chung Ah! Ha Eun Gyeol!

00:54:00.875 --> 00:54:01.936
It's me!

00:54:05.306 --> 00:54:07.746
Come on. That annoying jerk.

00:54:08.246 --> 00:54:10.016
You with the helmet. Stop!

00:54:10.215 --> 00:54:11.286
Gosh.

00:54:12.445 --> 00:54:14.516
- I just need to give them... - No.

00:54:19.025 --> 00:54:20.156
What's this?

00:54:20.326 --> 00:54:21.996
I thought we were getting T-shirts for the band.

00:54:22.355 --> 00:54:24.326
Designer Foot Mountain worked on this.

00:54:24.565 --> 00:54:26.326
I gave it an avant-garde look.

00:54:26.866 --> 00:54:29.266
Then Ma Joo's father charged us only for the fabric.

00:54:29.596 --> 00:54:30.665
Go.

00:54:31.065 --> 00:54:32.605
If you're in need of fabric,

00:54:32.706 --> 00:54:34.676
come to Ma Joo's Fabrics in Dongdaemun.

00:54:35.576 --> 00:54:38.405
There's a subsidiary called Ma Joo's Laces.

00:54:38.406 --> 00:54:41.215
This can't be a band T-shirt. It's a missing person poster.

00:54:41.415 --> 00:54:42.415
- This is so lame. - This is so lame.

00:54:42.416 --> 00:54:43.644
- How do you expect us to wear it? - How do you expect us to wear it?

00:54:43.645 --> 00:54:45.945
Why can't you wear it? Don't you have any loyalty at all?

00:54:46.145 --> 00:54:48.354
We'll wear them and give out flyers until we find him.

00:54:48.355 --> 00:54:50.116
That's all you have to know. Got it?

00:54:50.585 --> 00:54:51.755
Come on. This is a nice T-shirt.

00:54:52.585 --> 00:54:54.255
Gosh. It's Se Gyeong.

00:54:57.996 --> 00:54:59.695
Can someone put him back in the hospital?

00:55:00.326 --> 00:55:01.936
Preferably, a hospital he'll be locked up inside.

00:55:02.195 --> 00:55:03.735
You have one message.

00:55:04.465 --> 00:55:06.505
Yi Chan, brace yourself and listen up.

00:55:07.735 --> 00:55:10.105
Gosh, no way. Is she going to confess her feelings to me?

00:55:10.476 --> 00:55:13.005
I found Ha Eun Gyeol.

00:55:17.715 --> 00:55:18.845
Get out of my way!

00:55:18.846 --> 00:55:20.444
- I don't know how it happened, - Move, everyone! Out of my way!

00:55:20.445 --> 00:55:22.386
but he was at Seowon Arts High School with Yoon Chung Ah today.

00:55:26.585 --> 00:55:27.625
(Choi Se Gyeong)

00:55:30.525 --> 00:55:32.165
I'll look into this a bit more.

00:55:32.295 --> 00:55:34.294
Don't do anything rash until you fully recover...

00:55:34.295 --> 00:55:35.795
from your injuries.

00:55:43.605 --> 00:55:44.605
Guys.

00:55:45.945 --> 00:55:47.846
Why don't we stir up some trouble today?

00:55:51.215 --> 00:55:52.485
Did he live abroad?

00:55:53.215 --> 00:55:55.715
Being a gentleman is like second nature to him.

00:55:56.786 --> 00:55:58.386
A gentleman? As if.

00:55:58.625 --> 00:55:59.985
He's an orphan.

00:56:00.255 --> 00:56:01.825
A scholarship foundation from my father's company...

00:56:01.826 --> 00:56:02.854
is sponsoring him.

00:56:02.855 --> 00:56:04.226
What? Really?

00:56:05.266 --> 00:56:07.426
I have no idea how he managed to get my father on board.

00:56:08.136 --> 00:56:09.996
But he'll be staying at my house for the time being.

00:56:10.665 --> 00:56:12.664
In return, he'll do tutoring sessions at my house.

00:56:12.665 --> 00:56:16.306
He'll work as a part-timer at school as Yoon Chung Ah's assistant.

00:56:16.835 --> 00:56:18.805
He's basically a glorified servant.

00:56:18.806 --> 00:56:20.076
Yes. That's it.

00:56:20.676 --> 00:56:21.715
Gosh.

00:56:22.076 --> 00:56:23.746
I guess I have a thing for servants.

00:56:24.016 --> 00:56:25.584
I just understood why mistresses fell for servants.

00:56:25.585 --> 00:56:26.616
Hey.

00:56:26.945 --> 00:56:28.414
We have an announcement.

00:56:28.415 --> 00:56:30.555
A student named Ha Eun Gyeol in 11th grade...

00:56:30.556 --> 00:56:33.985
must report to the chairman's office upon hearing this announcement.

00:56:34.525 --> 00:56:36.096
Let me repeat the announcement.

00:56:36.556 --> 00:56:38.394
A student named Ha Eun Gyeol in 11th grade...

00:56:38.395 --> 00:56:39.925
must report to the chairman's office...

00:56:39.926 --> 00:56:42.065
- Someone is looking for me. - upon hearing this announcement.

00:56:42.465 --> 00:56:43.735
I'll be back soon.

00:56:44.136 --> 00:56:45.136
Will you be okay?

00:56:58.045 --> 00:56:59.085
Choi Se Gyeong

00:57:00.516 --> 00:57:02.084
What do you think you're doing?

00:57:02.085 --> 00:57:05.355
Gosh. I guess I wasn't invisible.

00:57:06.025 --> 00:57:07.025
Can you see me?

00:57:09.496 --> 00:57:10.826
Gosh. Come on.

00:57:13.795 --> 00:57:15.496
I need to talk to you. Come with me quietly.

00:57:15.695 --> 00:57:16.895
It's about Yi Chan.

00:57:18.706 --> 00:57:20.636
Hey.

00:57:24.645 --> 00:57:26.444
How much farther? Just talk to me here.

00:57:26.445 --> 00:57:28.976
Gosh. There's a reason I can't be seen. Seriously.

00:57:47.596 --> 00:57:49.436
Tell me what this is about. I must get going soon.

00:57:50.565 --> 00:57:52.105
What's your relationship with Yoon Chung Ah?

00:57:52.206 --> 00:57:54.035
You said this was about Yi Chan.

00:57:54.036 --> 00:57:56.135
Yes, it is about him. So just answer my question.

00:57:56.136 --> 00:57:57.944
Did you jump ship from Yi Chan to Yoon Chung Ah?

00:57:57.945 --> 00:57:59.805
Come on. How many times must I tell you...

00:57:59.806 --> 00:58:01.045
I don't have a thing for him?

00:58:01.145 --> 00:58:03.516
So you and I aren't love rivals.

00:58:03.676 --> 00:58:05.645
Then why do you hate me so much?

00:58:06.045 --> 00:58:07.285
Do you need a reason for that?

00:58:07.286 --> 00:58:08.715
Yes! I very much do!

00:58:08.815 --> 00:58:10.655
It's not fair to be hated without a reason.

00:58:10.656 --> 00:58:11.755
When I look at you,

00:58:14.895 --> 00:58:17.495
I just get angry. Anger drives me crazy!

00:58:17.496 --> 00:58:18.766
Okay? Are you happy now?

00:58:19.426 --> 00:58:21.734
Even so, how could you abandon Yi Chan because of me? You jerk.

00:58:21.735 --> 00:58:23.564
Yi Chan was giving out flyers to find you.

00:58:23.565 --> 00:58:24.565
That's how he got beaten up, got hit in the head,

00:58:24.566 --> 00:58:25.665
and was hospitalized too.

00:58:29.275 --> 00:58:30.835
Hello!

00:58:31.275 --> 00:58:34.415
Students of Seowon Arts High School!

00:58:34.715 --> 00:58:37.415
We're the school band from Baekwang High School.

00:58:37.476 --> 00:58:40.515
We are First Love Memory Manipulators!

00:58:40.516 --> 00:58:41.556
What?

00:58:42.286 --> 00:58:45.426
This is for all of you who must be exhausted from studying too hard.

00:58:45.826 --> 00:58:49.825
I would like to sing this song to show my support...

00:58:49.826 --> 00:58:52.426
- for your passion and youth... - Four, five, six,

00:58:53.195 --> 00:58:56.194
- seven, eight. One. - that must be burning brightly!

00:58:56.195 --> 00:58:57.495
- What's he doing? - Let's go.

00:58:57.496 --> 00:58:59.465
One, two.

00:58:59.565 --> 00:59:01.906
One, two, three, four.

00:59:02.835 --> 00:59:04.505
(Come back to us, Ha Eun Gyeol!)

00:59:06.176 --> 00:59:07.206
- Gosh. - Let's go.

00:59:16.516 --> 00:59:20.926
When I gaze at the setting sun, tinged with red

00:59:21.426 --> 00:59:24.625
The sad look on your face comes to my mind

00:59:25.096 --> 00:59:28.436
I sink my head, and tears fall down

00:59:28.766 --> 00:59:31.306
There's nothing I can say

00:59:31.406 --> 00:59:34.065
- But the truth is that I love you - But the truth is that I love you

00:59:34.775 --> 00:59:37.706
- You are my world - You are my world

00:59:38.505 --> 00:59:41.314
- I'm screaming that to the world - I'm screaming that to the world

00:59:41.315 --> 00:59:45.445
- But the setting sun burns silently - But the setting sun burns silently

00:59:46.045 --> 00:59:48.914
- The truth is that I love you - The truth is that I love you

00:59:48.915 --> 00:59:49.915
- Ha Eun Gyeol! - Ha Eun Gyeol!

00:59:49.916 --> 00:59:52.354
- You are my world - You are my world

00:59:52.355 --> 00:59:53.355
- Ha Eun Gyeol! - Ha Eun Gyeol!

00:59:53.356 --> 00:59:56.096
- I'm screaming that to the world - I'm screaming that to the world

00:59:56.125 --> 01:00:00.165
- But the setting sun burns silently - But the setting sun burns silently

01:00:02.096 --> 01:00:06.065
(Come back to us, Ha Eun Gyeol!)

01:00:12.246 --> 01:00:13.375
Welcome back, Eun Gyeol.

01:00:14.715 --> 01:00:16.176
I've been waiting for a long time.

01:00:17.246 --> 01:00:18.985
How did you know I was here?

01:00:19.346 --> 01:00:20.545
Se Gyeong told me.

01:00:24.156 --> 01:00:25.156
Eun Gyeol.

01:00:26.226 --> 01:00:27.386
I'm sorry.

01:00:29.255 --> 01:00:30.625
From now on, I'll do my best...

01:00:30.926 --> 01:00:32.795
for the band, to study,

01:00:33.266 --> 01:00:34.766
and to keep all of my promises to you.

01:00:36.065 --> 01:00:38.235
You might think you're wasting your time with me.

01:00:40.105 --> 01:00:41.335
But I'll try to make it worth your time.

01:00:42.105 --> 01:00:45.445
I'll do my best not to waste your time and to improve.

01:00:47.105 --> 01:00:48.415
So come back to us.

01:00:49.616 --> 01:00:52.485
You're the only guitarist for First Love Memory Manipulators.

01:01:06.426 --> 01:01:08.165
- Fine. Let's do it. - Really?

01:01:09.195 --> 01:01:11.734
You mean it, right? You can't back out now! Okay?

01:01:11.735 --> 01:01:14.234
- Under one condition. - Yes. What is it?

01:01:14.235 --> 01:01:16.335
Tell me anything you want. I'll make it happen for you.

01:01:17.206 --> 01:01:18.476
Stop seeing Choi Se Gyeong.

01:01:22.476 --> 01:01:23.476
What?

01:01:26.985 --> 01:01:28.415
If you don't, we can't play together...

01:01:29.516 --> 01:01:30.556
because...

01:01:32.286 --> 01:01:33.286
Because?

01:01:34.286 --> 01:01:35.895
I like Choi Se Gyeong.

01:01:36.625 --> 01:01:39.465
- The truth is that I love you - The truth is that I love you

01:01:40.165 --> 01:01:42.965
- You are my world - You are my world

01:01:43.795 --> 01:01:46.535
- I'm screaming that to the world - I'm screaming that to the world

01:01:46.536 --> 01:01:53.476
- But the setting sun burns silently - But the setting sun burns silently

01:02:33.945 --> 01:02:38.625
(Twinkling Watermelon)

01:02:38.826 --> 01:02:41.124
He told the entire school he liked me. How can he act like that?

01:02:41.125 --> 01:02:42.595
When can I get an answer?

01:02:42.596 --> 01:02:44.394
- What answer? - An answer to my confession.

01:02:44.395 --> 01:02:46.464
When you told me that you liked Se Gyeong,

01:02:46.465 --> 01:02:47.524
everything clicked.

01:02:47.525 --> 01:02:48.595
I'm sorry about that.

01:02:48.596 --> 01:02:49.964
Let's keep it fair between us.

01:02:49.965 --> 01:02:51.765
So both of us shouldn't see her until the school festival.

01:02:51.766 --> 01:02:53.065
Sure. I'm in!

01:02:53.235 --> 01:02:55.135
Se Gyeong will be going to school starting today.

01:02:55.136 --> 01:02:57.774
Then she'll be seeing that jerk, Ha Eun Gyeol, at school every day.

01:02:57.775 --> 01:03:00.245
From what I heard, they're already chasing each other.

01:03:00.246 --> 01:03:02.016
Why on earth are you going this far?

01:03:02.176 --> 01:03:04.275
I have no choice but to do this, so Mom and Dad end up together.

01:03:04.815 --> 01:03:07.215
Can you throw the ball only to me?
