(Staff ensured child actors'
safety in the filming of this drama.)

00:01:02.448 --> 00:01:03.647
Dad! It's cold!

00:01:03.978 --> 00:01:05.177
Help!

00:01:05.848 --> 00:01:06.978
Mom!

00:01:11.287 --> 00:01:12.787
Mom! Dad!

00:01:16.228 --> 00:01:18.498
Mom. Look at me.

00:01:19.498 --> 00:01:20.557
Dad.

00:01:22.027 --> 00:01:23.128
Eun Ho.

00:01:23.367 --> 00:01:25.397
Mom. Dad!

00:01:26.667 --> 00:01:28.408
Mom. Dad.

00:01:29.807 --> 00:01:30.836
Dad.

00:01:30.837 --> 00:01:33.738
If Eun Ho and I were both in danger,

00:01:34.078 --> 00:01:35.708
which one of us would you save first?

00:01:36.408 --> 00:01:38.177
You, of course.

00:01:39.617 --> 00:01:40.817
Eun Gyeol.

00:01:41.447 --> 00:01:45.018
You're the voice that
connects the family to the world.

00:01:47.527 --> 00:01:48.828
You're our angel.

00:01:49.628 --> 00:01:50.757
Liar.

00:01:51.757 --> 00:01:54.027
You couldn't even hear
me asking me for help.

00:01:55.498 --> 00:01:57.367
You wouldn't even know if I died.

00:01:59.138 --> 00:02:03.138
I see. So this is how it
feels not to hear any sounds.

00:02:04.208 --> 00:02:06.677
It feels like sinking into a deep ocean.

00:03:16.847 --> 00:03:19.177
(Episode 5)

00:03:26.458 --> 00:03:27.627
What are you doing out here?

00:03:28.427 --> 00:03:29.858
Are you watching over me?

00:03:34.897 --> 00:03:36.397
You must have been scared earlier.

00:03:37.298 --> 00:03:38.337
I'm sorry.

00:03:39.668 --> 00:03:41.538
Dad. You can't hear any sounds.

00:03:42.068 --> 00:03:44.068
How did you know that I was drowning?

00:03:44.708 --> 00:03:46.277
I may not be able to hear sounds,

00:03:46.437 --> 00:03:48.177
but I can see you guys.

00:03:49.478 --> 00:03:50.647
How?

00:03:53.847 --> 00:03:55.187
The Little Mermaid...

00:03:55.988 --> 00:03:58.217
gave her voice away to
the witch, but in exchange,

00:03:59.288 --> 00:04:01.087
she got two legs.

00:04:02.627 --> 00:04:04.927
I lost my voice.

00:04:05.027 --> 00:04:08.228
So I prayed again and again
to the deity. So in exchange...

00:04:10.198 --> 00:04:13.538
One, two, three.

00:04:13.638 --> 00:04:15.168
I got a third eye.

00:04:16.608 --> 00:04:19.637
I can watch you guys and
keep you safe wherever you are.

00:04:19.638 --> 00:04:20.907
It's the ultimate eye.

00:04:23.677 --> 00:04:25.418
Right here. My scar here...

00:04:26.147 --> 00:04:28.418
is the proof of that.

00:04:29.617 --> 00:04:32.087
He got the scar in exchange for his voice.

00:04:34.058 --> 00:04:35.188
Hey, wait.

00:04:36.558 --> 00:04:37.727
Watch out! No!

00:04:39.928 --> 00:04:41.097
Darn it.

00:04:47.268 --> 00:04:49.607
What if the accident
that gave him the scar...

00:04:50.107 --> 00:04:51.578
took away his hearing?

00:04:56.008 --> 00:04:57.477
Goodness.

00:04:57.917 --> 00:05:00.217
Hey, what's wrong with you? Are you crazy?

00:05:00.547 --> 00:05:01.618
Are you a pervert?

00:05:03.087 --> 00:05:04.357
The scar isn't there.

00:05:05.558 --> 00:05:06.618
What scar?

00:05:08.458 --> 00:05:10.787
The accident he told me
about hasn't happened yet.

00:05:11.227 --> 00:05:13.397
What scar am I supposed to have?

00:05:13.698 --> 00:05:15.128
If I stop the accident from happening,

00:05:15.467 --> 00:05:17.837
I may be able to change Dad's fate.

00:05:18.438 --> 00:05:21.107
What? Why are you glaring at me?

00:05:21.837 --> 00:05:23.337
Why are there lasers
coming out of your eyes?

00:05:26.777 --> 00:05:28.647
Listen carefully to what
I'm about to say right now.

00:05:29.277 --> 00:05:30.547
You need to be careful from now on.

00:05:31.018 --> 00:05:32.777
Don't get distracted by silly things.

00:05:33.347 --> 00:05:34.547
Focus only on me.

00:05:36.047 --> 00:05:40.057
You said "from now on." Until
when should I listen to you?

00:05:40.058 --> 00:05:41.058
Just for a year.

00:05:41.258 --> 00:05:42.258
What?

00:05:42.787 --> 00:05:44.628
You're going to mooch off me for a year?

00:05:44.797 --> 00:05:46.628
How dare you pull a fast one on me?

00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:48.027
Just for a year.

00:05:48.698 --> 00:05:50.596
Don't leave my sight just for a year.

00:05:50.597 --> 00:05:52.467
Don't stay away from me or disappear on me.

00:05:52.837 --> 00:05:54.198
Just stay right next to me.

00:05:54.337 --> 00:05:57.677
Hey. Did I tell you that I
liked Choi Se Gyeong?

00:05:57.678 --> 00:05:59.606
How many times must I say
you can't like Choi Se Gyeong?

00:05:59.607 --> 00:06:01.448
I don't need your permission!

00:06:03.047 --> 00:06:05.018
Do what I say just this once. Please?

00:06:05.448 --> 00:06:07.578
You just need to be
careful this year. Okay?

00:06:07.917 --> 00:06:09.448
I'll keep you safe no matter what.

00:06:09.717 --> 00:06:12.388
Don't do that. Please. I'm begging you.

00:06:12.487 --> 00:06:13.888
You don't have to protect me.

00:06:14.458 --> 00:06:15.927
I like women!

00:06:15.928 --> 00:06:18.396
You said Eun Ho and I
were gifts from the universe.

00:06:18.397 --> 00:06:20.757
The universe has shown us
the path. This is the divine will!

00:06:20.758 --> 00:06:22.726
So just do what I say!

00:06:22.727 --> 00:06:24.937
- Gosh. What nonsense is that?
- Watch out for that!

00:06:24.938 --> 00:06:26.698
- I'll take care of it!
- Don't run.

00:06:30.237 --> 00:06:32.378
The accident definitely happened this year.

00:06:33.337 --> 00:06:34.777
What kind of accident was it?

00:06:35.777 --> 00:06:37.378
What's the date of the accident?

00:06:38.078 --> 00:06:40.518
I must stay glued to
him until I find that out.

00:06:40.678 --> 00:06:41.917
Shut it.

00:06:42.217 --> 00:06:43.586
I didn't say anything yet.

00:06:43.587 --> 00:06:45.157
So continue to shut your mouth.

00:06:50.758 --> 00:06:51.828
Hey.

00:06:52.097 --> 00:06:53.828
Darn it. How dare you?

00:06:54.328 --> 00:06:55.797
You'd better not cross this line.

00:06:56.068 --> 00:06:59.237
Anything that comes over this
line will be twisted, cut, and broken.

00:07:00.397 --> 00:07:02.107
- Let's do it together.
- Do what?

00:07:02.337 --> 00:07:03.368
The band.

00:07:03.868 --> 00:07:06.037
I will give you the best band as a present.

00:07:06.178 --> 00:07:08.647
I will make your youth
twinkle just like your wish.

00:07:09.407 --> 00:07:10.647
But under one condition.

00:07:15.647 --> 00:07:17.857
What is it? What's the condition?

00:07:18.818 --> 00:07:21.888
Stay exactly where I can
see you just for a year.

00:07:23.758 --> 00:07:26.258
Grandma!

00:07:26.797 --> 00:07:29.027
I will do whatever it takes
to change Dad's future.

00:07:29.698 --> 00:07:33.138
That's the reason I
traveled back in time to 1995.

00:07:36.568 --> 00:07:39.378
Choi Se Gyeong. Don't
start dating other guys now.

00:07:39.438 --> 00:07:41.147
I'll be there starting next semester.

00:07:42.407 --> 00:07:44.948
But you're still coming back
during school breaks, right?

00:07:45.318 --> 00:07:48.047
No. I will never come back to Korea.

00:07:48.318 --> 00:07:50.547
Se Gyeong. We must go inside now.

00:07:51.888 --> 00:07:53.987
Thank you for coming
here to say goodbye today.

00:07:54.587 --> 00:07:56.727
Have a safe flight, ma'am.
You too, Se Gyeong.

00:07:59.128 --> 00:08:00.297
- Let's go.
- Okay.

00:08:27.018 --> 00:08:28.888
Hey, did you forget the promise
you made to Choi Se Gyeong?

00:08:29.128 --> 00:08:30.427
The school festival is next month.

00:08:30.428 --> 00:08:33.198
Our band will be disbanded if
we don't have enough people.

00:08:33.357 --> 00:08:34.767
We need everyone we can get.

00:08:34.768 --> 00:08:36.198
Why did you turn away someone
who wanted to join our band?

00:08:36.628 --> 00:08:37.938
I didn't turn him away.

00:08:38.068 --> 00:08:39.336
I just didn't give him an answer yet.

00:08:39.337 --> 00:08:41.037
Gosh. You must get him to join us.

00:08:41.237 --> 00:08:42.567
We must recruit him no matter what.

00:08:42.568 --> 00:08:44.167
You said he was an excellent guitarist.

00:08:44.337 --> 00:08:46.837
He keeps looking at me
with those burning eyes.

00:08:47.007 --> 00:08:48.506
His eyes are about to burn me to death!

00:08:48.507 --> 00:08:50.107
He's got a fighting spirit then.

00:08:50.278 --> 00:08:52.648
But enthusiasm isn't the
source. Romance seems to be it.

00:08:52.918 --> 00:08:54.116
What? What did you say?

00:08:54.117 --> 00:08:57.448
When he looks at me,
I get this cringy feeling.

00:08:57.617 --> 00:08:59.557
- Gosh.
- Just accept it, you jerk.

00:08:59.558 --> 00:09:01.787
You can glance at him like this then.

00:09:01.788 --> 00:09:03.227
You're saying that because
it's not happening to you.

00:09:03.627 --> 00:09:05.627
There's a saying that
it's okay to fight a tiger,

00:09:05.757 --> 00:09:07.757
but looking a madman in the
eye should be avoided at all costs.

00:09:08.267 --> 00:09:10.366
He said he would make you the best band.

00:09:10.367 --> 00:09:11.596
- Do you believe that jerk?
- Hey.

00:09:11.597 --> 00:09:13.898
How can that crazy guy form a band?

00:09:15.967 --> 00:09:18.037
- What? What's going on?
- What is it?

00:09:18.038 --> 00:09:19.677
- What's going on?
- Hey.

00:09:19.678 --> 00:09:21.207
- Hold on.
- What?

00:09:21.208 --> 00:09:22.448
Where are you going? What's going on?

00:09:22.578 --> 00:09:23.578
Let me have a sip of your milk.

00:09:24.377 --> 00:09:25.448
That's...

00:09:25.778 --> 00:09:26.877
That's my milk.

00:09:27.517 --> 00:09:29.147
The almighty guitarist, Kang Hyun Yul,

00:09:29.148 --> 00:09:30.616
is going to battle someone.

00:09:30.617 --> 00:09:31.917
- Kang Hyun Yul?
- Yes.

00:09:31.918 --> 00:09:34.188
- Who?
- I have no idea. I need to go now.

00:09:34.658 --> 00:09:35.757
What battle?

00:09:45.367 --> 00:09:47.068
It's the fourth week of April.

00:09:47.298 --> 00:09:51.837
It's the show, "Popular Battle!"

00:09:54.107 --> 00:09:55.447
What's he doing here?

00:09:55.448 --> 00:09:58.346
Today's battle will decide if
there will be a band or not.

00:09:58.347 --> 00:10:01.117
The battle of the century will unfold.

00:10:01.517 --> 00:10:04.317
I present you the two genius musicians...

00:10:04.318 --> 00:10:06.318
who will knock your socks off.

00:10:07.058 --> 00:10:09.828
He can create any genre of
music with just a bass guitar.

00:10:10.058 --> 00:10:11.957
Great King of Musical Tones,

00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:13.558
coveted by the independent
bands from Hongdae.

00:10:14.097 --> 00:10:17.967
The genius bassist, Kang Hyun Yul!

00:10:34.318 --> 00:10:35.387
Next.

00:10:36.087 --> 00:10:39.587
His vibe is the intro,
and his face is the genre.

00:10:39.788 --> 00:10:42.458
The mysterious genius guitarist,

00:10:43.058 --> 00:10:45.528
Ha Eun Gyeol!

00:10:47.798 --> 00:10:48.828
Go!

00:11:04.747 --> 00:11:05.778
Let me continue.

00:11:05.918 --> 00:11:07.717
I will now go over the
rules for today's battle.

00:11:07.987 --> 00:11:10.347
One of them will start first.

00:11:10.448 --> 00:11:12.957
Whoever goes second must play
something from the same genre.

00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:14.688
The format is similar to a jam session.

00:11:14.887 --> 00:11:17.327
Whoever can't keep up with
it will be the loser of the battle.

00:11:17.328 --> 00:11:20.257
But if it's a cool jam session,
it means they both nailed it.

00:11:21.528 --> 00:11:22.767
Let's decide who goes first.

00:11:24.168 --> 00:11:26.037
Heads or tails.

00:11:26.038 --> 00:11:27.168
- Heads.
- Tails.

00:11:28.908 --> 00:11:30.538
Kang Hyun Yul will lead.

00:11:34.678 --> 00:11:36.607
Kid, let's do well. Okay?

00:11:37.048 --> 00:11:39.448
Let's not try hard. Let's just do well.

00:11:41.487 --> 00:11:43.587
How cute. You have no
idea who you're dealing with.

00:11:44.688 --> 00:11:47.887
I get it. Teenagers
aren't scared of anything.

00:11:50.428 --> 00:11:52.757
It looks like he's going
to make a band for you.

00:11:53.257 --> 00:11:55.727
Hyun Yul is the laziest kid I know.
How did he get Hyun Yul to do this?

00:11:57.168 --> 00:11:58.568
You're that fake Yoon Dong Jin.

00:11:59.698 --> 00:12:00.698
Gosh.

00:12:01.198 --> 00:12:03.107
You're pretty good for a fake.

00:12:03.568 --> 00:12:04.937
I thought you left the band.

00:12:04.938 --> 00:12:08.078
Well, you see, this is my hotel.

00:12:08.607 --> 00:12:10.246
I see. You'll be out on the street soon.

00:12:10.247 --> 00:12:11.347
I heard the band was getting disbanded.

00:12:11.448 --> 00:12:13.016
By the way, what kind of style was that?

00:12:13.017 --> 00:12:14.148
I've never seen that before.

00:12:16.587 --> 00:12:17.617
You're not going to offer me anything?

00:12:18.688 --> 00:12:20.788
Gosh, cute. You know
how to play hard-to-get too.

00:12:21.987 --> 00:12:24.457
Forget it. This is already
turning into a hassle.

00:12:24.458 --> 00:12:25.657
There's a way for you...

00:12:25.658 --> 00:12:27.528
to learn this style and
keep your hotel too.

00:12:36.137 --> 00:12:37.208
Do you want to know?

00:12:38.538 --> 00:12:40.278
You must know some negotiation tactics.

00:12:41.038 --> 00:12:43.347
Sure. This is getting interesting.

00:12:47.918 --> 00:12:48.918
Tell me. What is it?

00:12:49.887 --> 00:12:51.418
Fine. I'm all ears.

00:12:54.757 --> 00:12:56.657
Join the band again with the
members of Baekwang Band.

00:12:56.658 --> 00:12:57.787
It will solve everything.

00:12:57.788 --> 00:12:59.727
I have no interest in forming a band...

00:13:00.458 --> 00:13:02.928
with Ha Yi Chan or
whatever his name is. Darn it.

00:13:03.467 --> 00:13:05.198
What if I were to take
Yoon Dong Jin's spot?

00:13:09.408 --> 00:13:11.366
- You want to take whose spot?
- Yoon Dong Jin's spot.

00:13:11.367 --> 00:13:13.537
This happened because
I wasn't Yoon Dong Jin.

00:13:13.538 --> 00:13:14.908
So I'll take his place.

00:13:15.278 --> 00:13:17.507
Well, I can show you what I
can do if you don't think I can do it.

00:13:18.977 --> 00:13:20.448
You're a brave kid, aren't you?

00:13:21.048 --> 00:13:24.287
But do you think you have
enough skills to play with me?

00:13:24.288 --> 00:13:26.257
It might be too much for a fake to handle.

00:13:30.688 --> 00:13:31.757
What's this?

00:13:35.298 --> 00:13:37.168
A token of our deal.

00:13:38.028 --> 00:13:39.538
You pick the date for the battle.

00:13:45.808 --> 00:13:47.007
(Watermelon-flavored Ice Pop)

00:13:57.847 --> 00:13:59.658
- He's so good.
- He's amazing.

00:14:00.658 --> 00:14:01.928
He's great.

00:16:13.017 --> 00:16:15.687
Hey, thank you! Seriously.

00:16:15.688 --> 00:16:17.987
Gosh. That was amazing. Thank you.

00:16:20.428 --> 00:16:21.668
(School Club Application Form)

00:16:26.597 --> 00:16:29.308
I said no. How many times must I say it?

00:16:29.607 --> 00:16:31.937
You need at least five
students in your club.

00:16:31.938 --> 00:16:34.476
Otherwise, I can't approve
of your school club, you punk.

00:16:34.477 --> 00:16:35.548
Yes, sir.

00:16:38.717 --> 00:16:39.777
(Manager Oh Ma Joo, Bassist Kang Hyun Yul)

00:16:39.778 --> 00:16:40.817
(Drummer Lee Si Guk,
Keyboard Player No Se Bum)

00:16:40.818 --> 00:16:41.847
(Guitarist Ha Eun Gyeol)

00:16:43.717 --> 00:16:45.418
- So there are six people.
- Yes.

00:16:45.658 --> 00:16:48.558
This form needs your
signature as the final touch now.

00:16:48.828 --> 00:16:49.928
Please, sir.

00:17:25.898 --> 00:17:27.326
Don't be scared. Glare at them.

00:17:27.327 --> 00:17:28.628
We must have the upper
hand in this power dynamic.

00:17:35.737 --> 00:17:38.338
Hey, guys. You're here.

00:17:39.237 --> 00:17:41.277
Welcome to The Manipulators.

00:17:42.148 --> 00:17:45.178
Gosh. Did you eat, sir?

00:17:45.477 --> 00:17:48.016
Darn it. Do you think we're
some sacrificial lambs?

00:17:48.017 --> 00:17:49.587
- Okay.
- You're the one who lost the bet.

00:17:49.588 --> 00:17:51.817
Why must we bear the consequences with you?

00:17:53.257 --> 00:17:55.757
His name is Lee Si Guk. He goes by Mangguk.

00:17:56.128 --> 00:17:58.897
He looks as if he would play
mahjong in Kowloon Walled City.

00:17:58.898 --> 00:18:00.658
He has that look, but he goes to church.

00:18:01.628 --> 00:18:03.467
Surprisingly, he was born a Christian.

00:18:10.868 --> 00:18:12.807
But when his rock spirit is unleashed...

00:18:23.918 --> 00:18:25.688
Welcome to the dark world.

00:18:26.717 --> 00:18:27.987
A drummer from the dark world.

00:18:28.557 --> 00:18:29.557
Gosh.

00:18:30.128 --> 00:18:31.257
Calm down, Mangguk.

00:18:31.557 --> 00:18:33.027
He's not Yoon Dong Jin,

00:18:33.198 --> 00:18:35.398
but it's true that he brought
someone as good as him.

00:18:38.027 --> 00:18:40.537
His name is No Se Bum. DO is his nickname.

00:18:40.868 --> 00:18:41.868
"DO?"

00:18:45.178 --> 00:18:46.437
He studied classical piano.

00:18:46.438 --> 00:18:48.036
He went to Germany
at age 13 to study music,

00:18:48.037 --> 00:18:49.806
but he failed and came
back. He's an ill-fated genius.

00:18:49.807 --> 00:18:51.108
The reason why he failed...

00:18:54.517 --> 00:18:55.618
was stage fright.

00:18:56.918 --> 00:18:59.158
When he makes a mistake, feels nervous,

00:18:59.418 --> 00:19:01.486
or is terrified, his face
gets extremely oily,

00:19:01.487 --> 00:19:03.026
instead of being sweaty.

00:19:03.027 --> 00:19:05.627
That's why his nickname
is DO. "Dry and Oily."

00:19:05.628 --> 00:19:07.098
In short, DO.

00:19:08.098 --> 00:19:09.928
Anyway, a bet is a bet.

00:19:10.428 --> 00:19:11.667
So I'll accept it without complaining.

00:19:11.668 --> 00:19:13.937
Oh, you must be the brains
of the Baekwang Band.

00:19:13.938 --> 00:19:14.997
But,

00:19:16.438 --> 00:19:17.838
we want to absorb your band.

00:19:18.438 --> 00:19:19.737
That's nonsense.

00:19:19.908 --> 00:19:22.448
We got approval for the club as
First Love Memory Manipulators.

00:19:24.678 --> 00:19:27.276
Then change the front man at least.

00:19:27.277 --> 00:19:29.417
- What?
- I told you.

00:19:29.418 --> 00:19:31.117
We don't use backing tracks.

00:19:31.118 --> 00:19:33.187
Hey, you clever one. I
was immature back then.

00:19:33.188 --> 00:19:34.556
You're not only immature,

00:19:34.557 --> 00:19:35.887
but you also don't have what
it takes to be the front man.

00:19:35.888 --> 00:19:38.127
"I don't have what it takes?"
Why do you think that?

00:19:38.128 --> 00:19:39.627
I'm the one who made this band.

00:19:39.628 --> 00:19:41.497
Honestly, that's not true.

00:19:42.267 --> 00:19:44.297
He should take 99 percent of the credit.

00:19:45.638 --> 00:19:48.806
He's right. I'll accept
it if he's the front man.

00:19:48.807 --> 00:19:51.708
I don't even go to this
school. I can't do that.

00:19:51.737 --> 00:19:54.108
What should I do to make you
acknowledge me as the front man?

00:19:55.037 --> 00:19:56.077
Tell me.

00:19:56.408 --> 00:19:57.408
Hey, Brain.

00:19:57.678 --> 00:19:58.747
Hyun Yul.

00:19:58.918 --> 00:19:59.976
Si Guk.

00:19:59.977 --> 00:20:01.717
What should I do to make
you acknowledge me?

00:20:16.467 --> 00:20:18.267
("Walking to the Sky")

00:20:28.878 --> 00:20:32.147
On snowy nights

00:20:32.148 --> 00:20:35.687
I can't help but think about the past

00:20:35.688 --> 00:20:39.056
It reminds me of you

00:20:39.057 --> 00:20:42.986
- Hidden deep in my heart -
Okay. Make it a key higher!

00:20:42.987 --> 00:20:45.757
When I was wandering around

00:20:46.027 --> 00:20:49.766
In the dark maze

00:20:49.767 --> 00:20:52.837
I didn't know

00:20:52.838 --> 00:20:56.306
- Why I had to live - Okay. One key higher.

00:20:56.307 --> 00:20:59.776
But I could get by each day

00:20:59.777 --> 00:21:03.147
Because I had you

00:21:03.148 --> 00:21:06.246
I want to give you everything

00:21:06.247 --> 00:21:11.887
For you

00:21:11.888 --> 00:21:13.217
Even the last piece

00:21:15.188 --> 00:21:17.158
Yi Chan, are you okay? Hey!

00:21:18.458 --> 00:21:19.697
Hey, get up.

00:21:19.698 --> 00:21:20.898
Are you giving up on being the front man?

00:21:23.898 --> 00:21:26.198
Darn it. An audition?

00:21:27.267 --> 00:21:28.398
An audition?

00:21:28.908 --> 00:21:32.007
Why do I have to do an
audition in front of them? Why?

00:21:33.507 --> 00:21:35.306
A promise is a promise.

00:21:35.307 --> 00:21:36.948
So let's practice just one more time.

00:21:37.148 --> 00:21:38.277
What if I practice?

00:21:38.717 --> 00:21:40.347
You should be able to play...

00:21:40.348 --> 00:21:42.017
an instrument at least as the front man.

00:21:42.618 --> 00:21:43.717
Is it possible?

00:21:44.388 --> 00:21:48.287
You should be able to sustain
three high notes at least as a vocalist.

00:21:48.827 --> 00:21:51.757
Is it possible to do
all that in three days?

00:21:52.057 --> 00:21:54.026
It'd be quicker for me to be born again.

00:21:54.027 --> 00:21:55.796
Even if you're born again,
you'll be who you are now.

00:21:55.797 --> 00:21:58.996
Or I could make a son
somewhere and bring him.

00:21:58.997 --> 00:22:01.237
He would have the same genes anyway.

00:22:01.368 --> 00:22:03.307
What if you have a
son who is just like you?

00:22:03.408 --> 00:22:04.868
My gosh. It's cold.

00:22:05.108 --> 00:22:07.708
- Oh, my. Where did it come from?
- It's cold.

00:22:08.338 --> 00:22:09.348
Was it you?

00:22:10.448 --> 00:22:11.577
What are you doing?

00:22:11.948 --> 00:22:13.178
Sorry.

00:22:14.118 --> 00:22:17.486
Hey, why don't we hold an
audition to pick our own bandmates?

00:22:17.487 --> 00:22:19.158
That's it.

00:22:19.388 --> 00:22:21.158
What do you mean?

00:22:21.257 --> 00:22:23.827
Don't forget that the
festival is in next month.

00:22:25.997 --> 00:22:27.297
- Ma Joo.
- Yes?

00:22:27.928 --> 00:22:29.698
- Don't stop me.
- What?

00:22:29.928 --> 00:22:31.227
I'll be born again.

00:22:32.067 --> 00:22:33.698
Hey.

00:22:34.598 --> 00:22:35.608
Hey.

00:22:47.477 --> 00:22:48.848
No!

00:23:04.497 --> 00:23:05.698
I'll teach you.

00:23:06.938 --> 00:23:07.967
Teach me what?

00:23:08.037 --> 00:23:09.868
Anything. Whatever it is.

00:23:10.868 --> 00:23:12.077
Everything you need.

00:23:15.108 --> 00:23:16.378
(Sung Moon English)

00:23:17.408 --> 00:23:18.477
What's this?

00:23:19.148 --> 00:23:20.247
Is this my first birthday party?

00:23:20.477 --> 00:23:21.648
Do I get to pick one of these?

00:23:21.747 --> 00:23:24.848
Whatever you choose,
you must do the other one.

00:23:26.787 --> 00:23:28.688
You know...

00:23:29.027 --> 00:23:30.887
Are you going to die or something...

00:23:30.888 --> 00:23:33.128
if you explain it so that I can
understand it from the beginning?

00:23:34.628 --> 00:23:35.727
Yi Chan.

00:23:36.868 --> 00:23:38.698
Do you want to be the front man that badly?

00:23:41.067 --> 00:23:43.168
You saw me almost throwing up
blood at the karaoke earlier, right?

00:23:43.408 --> 00:23:44.507
Why do you think I did that?

00:23:45.477 --> 00:23:48.638
Okay. I got it. I'll help you then.

00:23:49.277 --> 00:23:50.647
I'll do a band with you.

00:23:50.648 --> 00:23:52.476
I'll teach you how to play
guitar. I'll do everything for you.

00:23:52.477 --> 00:23:54.348
- In return, you...
- What?

00:23:54.747 --> 00:23:55.787
go to college.

00:23:56.817 --> 00:23:58.717
Why are you talking about
college out of nowhere?

00:23:58.918 --> 00:24:00.556
I told you. I'll make money
as soon as I graduate.

00:24:00.557 --> 00:24:01.817
It's your grandma's wish.

00:24:07.757 --> 00:24:09.397
What's this?

00:24:09.398 --> 00:24:11.598
It's only a little.

00:24:11.628 --> 00:24:15.067
No. I'm already grateful
that you let me live here.

00:24:15.138 --> 00:24:17.338
I said it was only a little.

00:24:18.737 --> 00:24:20.938
This is not for teaching my
grandson. It's pocket money.

00:24:21.237 --> 00:24:22.448
No.

00:24:22.608 --> 00:24:25.577
Think of it as my
offering and just take it.

00:24:26.077 --> 00:24:28.817
Yi Chan is my dream.

00:24:29.148 --> 00:24:31.588
And this is my offering for my dream.

00:24:36.727 --> 00:24:40.098
There's a family issue I can't say.

00:24:40.428 --> 00:24:44.128
So Yi Chan grew up
without knowing parental love.

00:24:45.227 --> 00:24:47.297
He got pretty good grades.

00:24:47.368 --> 00:24:48.598
But because of me...

00:24:49.108 --> 00:24:52.338
He must've thought that this
old woman was struggling.

00:24:52.838 --> 00:24:56.577
So he kept saying that he
wasn't interested in studying.

00:24:56.747 --> 00:24:58.477
And that he would make money...

00:24:58.678 --> 00:25:00.348
because he'd be better at it.

00:25:01.317 --> 00:25:04.088
He thinks that he's being a good grandson.

00:25:06.987 --> 00:25:09.587
Running a guesthouse for decades,

00:25:09.588 --> 00:25:12.428
I made food and did
laundry for college students.

00:25:13.227 --> 00:25:16.598
I've put all their graduation caps
on my head on graduation day.

00:25:18.527 --> 00:25:19.967
But...

00:25:21.267 --> 00:25:23.967
I don't have a big dream.

00:25:24.938 --> 00:25:28.108
I just want to see my grandson
wearing a graduation cap.

00:25:29.448 --> 00:25:31.007
That's all I wish for.

00:25:33.047 --> 00:25:34.378
Do you think it will come true?

00:25:40.817 --> 00:25:44.688
It's not like I'll be accepted just
because I want to go to college.

00:25:45.628 --> 00:25:46.958
I'll teach you.

00:25:48.598 --> 00:25:50.368
You can go to college if you
start working hard from now on.

00:25:51.928 --> 00:25:54.037
Why? Do you not want to do it?

00:25:55.168 --> 00:25:57.467
Hey, you can try at least.

00:26:02.138 --> 00:26:03.807
I've been always curious.

00:26:04.678 --> 00:26:06.477
Why are you so nice to me?

00:26:07.648 --> 00:26:09.388
- What?
- Am I wrong?

00:26:09.618 --> 00:26:11.187
You helped me when I
almost disgraced myself...

00:26:11.188 --> 00:26:12.317
in front of Se Gyeong.

00:26:12.487 --> 00:26:13.817
You saved my life.

00:26:14.017 --> 00:26:15.757
You said you would make a band for me.

00:26:16.358 --> 00:26:18.997
And you want to teach me
how to study and play guitar.

00:26:20.628 --> 00:26:22.428
Are you doing all this because
you don't want to be kicked out?

00:26:24.267 --> 00:26:25.267
No.

00:26:25.268 --> 00:26:27.668
Then what? Do you want
to sell something to me?

00:26:30.368 --> 00:26:32.737
You saved my life many
times in your previous life.

00:26:34.777 --> 00:26:35.807
I did?

00:26:38.848 --> 00:26:40.017
You really did.

00:26:46.517 --> 00:26:47.658
In the fire.

00:27:02.838 --> 00:27:03.938
In the water.

00:27:05.467 --> 00:27:06.537
And...

00:27:09.878 --> 00:27:10.878
Open your book.

00:27:12.247 --> 00:27:14.618
Right now? All of a sudden?

00:27:20.517 --> 00:27:21.958
Today is our first day together.

00:27:23.158 --> 00:27:25.698
No, please. Grandma!

00:27:27.898 --> 00:27:30.227
Grandma, help me!

00:27:31.198 --> 00:27:32.467
Read your book!

00:27:35.438 --> 00:27:36.466
You're hitting me again?

00:27:36.467 --> 00:27:38.237
I like girls.

00:27:43.908 --> 00:27:44.908
Look at that.

00:27:44.909 --> 00:27:47.277
Hey, what are you guys doing?

00:27:48.178 --> 00:27:49.848
- What is it?
- Come here.

00:27:51.948 --> 00:27:55.216
- Look.
- "I have a dream that..."

00:27:55.217 --> 00:27:56.757
"one day this..."

00:27:57.128 --> 00:27:58.996
- "Nation."
- "nation..."

00:27:58.997 --> 00:28:02.526
"will rise up and live out..."

00:28:02.527 --> 00:28:04.297
But why is this "that" here?

00:28:04.567 --> 00:28:06.497
You haven't learned
about relative pronouns yet?

00:28:06.898 --> 00:28:08.237
What? They're relatives?

00:28:11.767 --> 00:28:14.306
Ms. Go, why are you crying?

00:28:14.307 --> 00:28:17.177
Ms. Go, if others saw you now,
they'd think Yi Chan got into SNU.

00:28:17.178 --> 00:28:18.877
He'll have no problem
becoming a judge or a prosecutor.

00:28:18.878 --> 00:28:21.348
Ms. Go, I told you that you
didn't have to worry about Yi Chan.

00:28:37.098 --> 00:28:38.967
Hi, I'm in New York now.

00:28:39.598 --> 00:28:41.237
Have you missed me, even just a little bit?

00:28:41.838 --> 00:28:43.907
I was a little sad because
you didn't come to the airport,

00:28:43.908 --> 00:28:45.638
but I should understand,
being the nice person that I am.

00:28:46.608 --> 00:28:49.148
I'll write you a proper letter
once I'm done organizing my stuff.

00:28:49.277 --> 00:28:50.708
I just wanted to let
you know I'm doing well.

00:28:51.448 --> 00:28:53.648
Now, you have my
address. Write me some time.

00:28:53.977 --> 00:28:55.017
From Se Gyeong.

00:29:01.618 --> 00:29:02.658
PS.

00:29:03.327 --> 00:29:05.928
Everyone at school must now
know that I've left to study abroad.

00:29:06.497 --> 00:29:07.658
I don't have to see it to know...

00:29:08.158 --> 00:29:10.227
how happy they must be to have
one less person to compete with.

00:29:11.797 --> 00:29:15.098
I wonder if anyone
is truly sad that I left.

00:29:20.537 --> 00:29:22.777
(The 2nd Hongdae Culture Festival)

00:29:26.448 --> 00:29:29.287
(Buy and Sell Used Books)

00:29:54.577 --> 00:29:55.577
My gosh.

00:30:25.267 --> 00:30:26.307
"My left hand is there..."

00:30:28.307 --> 00:30:29.348
"solely as support."

00:31:39.007 --> 00:31:41.277
What? You're not going
walk in and out the door?

00:31:42.448 --> 00:31:44.087
I'm sorry about that day.

00:31:44.088 --> 00:31:45.317
Today, I'm here to buy some books.

00:31:49.327 --> 00:31:50.487
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

00:31:50.888 --> 00:31:52.427
I was just about to head
over to the guesthouse.

00:31:52.428 --> 00:31:53.496
Where are you coming from?

00:31:53.497 --> 00:31:55.597
I was at a bookstore to get
some books for Yi Chan. You?

00:31:55.598 --> 00:31:56.927
I was at the burger shop over there...

00:31:56.928 --> 00:31:58.368
to meet with the festival
preparation committee.

00:31:58.698 --> 00:32:01.497
After pressuring them
and doing a lot of lobbying,

00:32:01.737 --> 00:32:04.167
I managed to snag the
last slot at the festival.

00:32:04.168 --> 00:32:06.776
My gosh. You mean, we'll
give the closing performance?

00:32:06.777 --> 00:32:08.237
That's right!

00:32:08.638 --> 00:32:10.707
Aren't you getting a
feeling that it'll go very well?

00:32:10.708 --> 00:32:12.577
Oh, my. This is amazing.

00:32:13.817 --> 00:32:15.917
- Girls, did you hear the rumor?
- What rumor?

00:32:15.918 --> 00:32:17.087
About the new member...

00:32:17.088 --> 00:32:18.888
of Baekwang High's band
who showed up out of nowhere.

00:32:19.017 --> 00:32:21.457
He's a new guitarist Ha Yi Chan recruited.

00:32:21.458 --> 00:32:22.957
I heard he was very talented.

00:32:22.958 --> 00:32:24.388
Yes, I heard that too.

00:32:24.557 --> 00:32:26.397
I heard he saved the band
from being disbanded...

00:32:26.398 --> 00:32:28.927
and blew everyone away
with his amazing guitar skills.

00:32:28.928 --> 00:32:30.967
On top of being such a talented guitarist,

00:32:31.168 --> 00:32:33.337
he's super handsome too.

00:32:33.338 --> 00:32:35.097
- Really?
- Let's go see him at the festival.

00:32:35.098 --> 00:32:36.368
- Yes!
- Yes, let's do that.

00:32:37.067 --> 00:32:38.707
Ha Yi Chan is very lucky.

00:32:38.708 --> 00:32:41.007
He found such a talented new
member and managed to save the band.

00:32:41.737 --> 00:32:42.746
What's the point?

00:32:42.747 --> 00:32:44.276
Se Gyeong is not here.
She went abroad to study.

00:32:44.277 --> 00:32:45.947
She's not even here to watch him perform.

00:32:45.948 --> 00:32:47.047
He's wasting his time.

00:32:47.178 --> 00:32:48.247
That's true.

00:32:49.948 --> 00:32:51.118
Gosh, I'm hungry.

00:32:51.787 --> 00:32:52.888
(Snail Guesthouse)

00:32:54.217 --> 00:32:55.986
If he finds out that she left
the country to study abroad,

00:32:55.987 --> 00:32:57.128
he'll be shocked, right?

00:32:57.388 --> 00:32:58.858
Yes, obviously.

00:32:59.227 --> 00:33:00.496
He'll be totally devastated.

00:33:00.497 --> 00:33:02.227
- What about the band, then?
- He won't bother.

00:33:02.727 --> 00:33:04.698
Se Gyeong was the
reason he started the band.

00:33:06.067 --> 00:33:08.467
But we can finally say that
the band is now complete.

00:33:08.737 --> 00:33:11.266
I worked so hard to snag the
slot for the closing performance.

00:33:11.267 --> 00:33:13.678
And he has finally made
up his mind to start studying.

00:33:14.477 --> 00:33:15.536
If we go back on the decision,

00:33:15.537 --> 00:33:17.807
the head of the festival
preparation committee will kill me.

00:33:18.608 --> 00:33:23.188
But must we let all of Yi
Chan's efforts go to waste?

00:33:25.487 --> 00:33:26.587
No.

00:33:26.588 --> 00:33:27.618
- We won't tell him.
- We won't tell him.

00:33:41.898 --> 00:33:43.908
Hey, can't you knock?

00:33:44.168 --> 00:33:45.338
Can't you see that I'm studying?

00:33:45.967 --> 00:33:47.938
Oh, sorry.

00:33:52.378 --> 00:33:53.648
- Hey, Ma Joo.
- Yes?

00:33:53.747 --> 00:33:54.816
Why are you here again?

00:33:54.817 --> 00:33:58.216
I'm here for your grandma's
famous spicy noodles.

00:33:58.217 --> 00:34:00.287
Who do you think you are, coming
here for noodles whenever you want?

00:34:00.787 --> 00:34:03.256
Grandma! No noodles for him!

00:34:03.257 --> 00:34:06.257
No, Grandma. I want a double portion!

00:34:08.027 --> 00:34:09.027
A double portion?

00:34:10.827 --> 00:34:11.898
Here.

00:34:13.467 --> 00:34:14.537
I did my homework.

00:34:23.708 --> 00:34:26.377
Oh, my. You really solved everything.

00:34:26.378 --> 00:34:27.747
Give me my reward as you promised.

00:34:31.988 --> 00:34:32.988
Good job.

00:34:34.188 --> 00:34:35.818
- What was that?
- You asked for a reward.

00:34:36.488 --> 00:34:37.726
Here's my special compliment.

00:34:37.727 --> 00:34:39.657
Hey! What am I, a dog?

00:34:39.898 --> 00:34:41.857
I finished my homework,

00:34:41.858 --> 00:34:44.067
so teach me how to play the guitar!

00:34:44.068 --> 00:34:46.036
Come and have some noodles, guys!

00:34:46.037 --> 00:34:47.568
Noodles! Come on.

00:34:48.037 --> 00:34:50.866
Noodles, I like banquet noodles

(Snail Guesthouse)

00:34:52.778 --> 00:34:55.636
I cooked plenty of noodles,
so eat as much as you want.

00:34:55.637 --> 00:34:56.877
- Okay!
- Okay!

00:34:56.878 --> 00:34:58.778
Eat up, Mr. Tutor.

00:34:59.378 --> 00:35:02.477
You must've been stressed
out, trying to tutor this fool.

00:35:03.617 --> 00:35:05.148
Grandma, your grandson is right here.

00:35:06.988 --> 00:35:08.988
I am her great-grandson.

00:35:13.298 --> 00:35:14.358
Here.

00:35:15.628 --> 00:35:16.696
- Can I have some more?
- Thank you.

00:35:16.697 --> 00:35:18.168
- Sure thing.
- Hey, Yi Chan.

00:35:19.168 --> 00:35:20.597
Are you sure...

00:35:21.068 --> 00:35:23.037
Choi Se Gyeong will come to the festival?

00:35:24.208 --> 00:35:25.267
Yes, of course.

00:35:25.537 --> 00:35:27.838
If I'm well-prepared, she'll
surely come to watch the show.

00:35:28.378 --> 00:35:29.447
Really?

00:35:30.347 --> 00:35:33.517
Then I'll bring everyone
from my department.

00:35:33.947 --> 00:35:35.516
I heard she was very pretty.

00:35:35.517 --> 00:35:37.588
- Hey, I'm coming too!
- Me too.

00:35:41.387 --> 00:35:44.028
Now that you've brought her
up, I suddenly miss her like crazy.

00:35:44.827 --> 00:35:46.426
Shall I go and see her in secret?

00:35:46.427 --> 00:35:47.458
- No!
- No!

00:35:48.028 --> 00:35:50.297
Gosh, that was gross.
What was that, you guys?

00:35:50.298 --> 00:35:52.697
Did you have to spit out
noodles like that? What a waste.

00:35:52.867 --> 00:35:55.196
You promised me you wouldn't
see her until the day of the festival!

00:35:55.197 --> 00:35:56.866
A man must keep his
promises. You know that!

00:35:56.867 --> 00:35:58.067
That's right, loser.

00:35:58.068 --> 00:35:59.877
If you want to date her,
you must play hard to get.

00:35:59.878 --> 00:36:01.607
Make a grand entrance like a dark horse...

00:36:01.608 --> 00:36:02.977
to impress Se Gyeong!

00:36:03.608 --> 00:36:04.677
Like a dark horse?

00:36:07.818 --> 00:36:09.177
They do have a point, right?

00:36:09.787 --> 00:36:11.717
Well... Yes, I guess.

00:36:11.718 --> 00:36:12.887
- Yes.
- For sure.

00:36:14.887 --> 00:36:16.088
You can do this, Yi Chan.

00:36:17.387 --> 00:36:18.827
Hold out just until
the day of the festival.

00:36:25.128 --> 00:36:26.797
- Here, have some.
- It's okay. It's all yours.

00:36:26.798 --> 00:36:27.997
I'm sorry, Dad.

00:36:28.867 --> 00:36:30.407
She left to study abroad.

00:36:30.968 --> 00:36:32.108
And...

00:36:32.168 --> 00:36:35.438
I moved to the US in 11th grade
to study abroad and stayed there...

00:36:35.778 --> 00:36:37.477
until I heard he'd passed away.

00:36:38.108 --> 00:36:39.718
And she won't come back.

00:37:27.057 --> 00:37:28.156
Thank you.

00:37:28.157 --> 00:37:30.397
I forgot to bring the key from the US.

00:37:30.398 --> 00:37:32.597
For some reason, I didn't
want to leave early today.

00:37:33.767 --> 00:37:36.467
Anyway, you left a few days ago.

00:37:36.468 --> 00:37:37.907
How come you're back already?

00:37:40.278 --> 00:37:43.048
I came back for a few days to
take care of something urgent.

00:37:43.148 --> 00:37:44.177
I see.

00:38:02.758 --> 00:38:03.997
I'm sorry, Mom.

00:38:06.028 --> 00:38:08.537
I can no longer be the
daughter you want me to be.

00:38:14.037 --> 00:38:15.077
I'm sorry.

00:38:16.508 --> 00:38:17.747
I'm really sorry.

00:38:20.878 --> 00:38:22.318
To tell you the truth...

00:38:27.088 --> 00:38:28.517
I'm not sorry at all.

00:38:32.488 --> 00:38:33.657
I have a bad feeling.

00:38:34.157 --> 00:38:35.227
That dream...

00:38:35.927 --> 00:38:37.097
I have an ominous feeling.

00:39:03.427 --> 00:39:04.557
Why are you still up?

00:39:05.028 --> 00:39:06.926
I'm auditioning tomorrow
to be the front man,

00:39:06.927 --> 00:39:07.958
so I have to practice.

00:39:10.068 --> 00:39:11.227
Gosh.

00:39:16.037 --> 00:39:18.438
With musical instruments, you
simply can't cram the night before.

00:39:24.347 --> 00:39:25.847
Why don't you practice singing instead?

00:39:25.878 --> 00:39:28.918
I should try my best to keep my promise.

00:39:30.048 --> 00:39:31.247
Seriously though.

00:39:31.648 --> 00:39:32.846
I'm doing exactly what you taught me.

00:39:32.847 --> 00:39:34.218
What's wrong with me?

00:39:34.458 --> 00:39:35.617
It sounds so weird.

00:39:37.057 --> 00:39:38.057
Hand it over.

00:39:39.458 --> 00:39:40.927
Gosh, I'm so frustrated.

00:39:45.767 --> 00:39:49.637
It hasn't been tuned in a while,
so the wood soaked up moisture.

00:40:00.747 --> 00:40:01.847
My gosh.

00:40:03.088 --> 00:40:04.818
What can I do to be as good as you?

00:40:05.017 --> 00:40:06.657
Learn to talk to the guitar.

00:40:07.258 --> 00:40:08.258
"Talk to the guitar?"

00:40:08.958 --> 00:40:09.988
Watch.

00:40:15.657 --> 00:40:17.298
If you speak from your heart,

00:40:22.898 --> 00:40:24.307
it'll also answer from the heart.

00:40:26.807 --> 00:40:28.577
Talk sweetly,

00:40:32.278 --> 00:40:33.577
and it'll answer sweetly.

00:40:35.148 --> 00:40:36.488
If you get angry,

00:40:46.028 --> 00:40:47.427
the guitar will get angry too.

00:40:51.798 --> 00:40:53.068
If you're excited,

00:40:56.367 --> 00:40:57.607
the guitar will get excited too.

00:40:57.608 --> 00:40:59.508
My gosh! That was crazy cool.

00:41:00.077 --> 00:41:01.577
Oh, my. That's amazing.

00:41:01.907 --> 00:41:04.508
You talk to it using your
fingers, and it answers in sounds.

00:41:04.807 --> 00:41:06.278
In a way, it's like sign language...

00:41:08.378 --> 00:41:09.477
Sign language? What about it?

00:41:12.688 --> 00:41:14.017
It's similar to sign language.

00:41:14.418 --> 00:41:16.418
Hey, that's such a cool analogy.

00:41:18.458 --> 00:41:19.657
My gosh.

00:41:22.258 --> 00:41:24.297
Technique isn't important.

00:41:24.298 --> 00:41:25.898
Your sincerity is what matters.

00:41:27.997 --> 00:41:31.267
If the listeners can feel
your emotions and sincerity,

00:41:31.708 --> 00:41:33.677
you know you're making great music.

00:41:34.208 --> 00:41:35.238
Yes, sir.

00:42:11.577 --> 00:42:14.817
(Snail Guesthouse)

00:42:14.818 --> 00:42:17.417
Ms. Go, can we have
more of the rolled omelet?

00:42:17.418 --> 00:42:19.786
Yes, here it is.

00:42:19.787 --> 00:42:20.818
Here you go.

00:42:22.517 --> 00:42:23.657
Thank you.

00:42:34.238 --> 00:42:35.398
What is going on here?

00:42:37.867 --> 00:42:40.238
Everyone would believe you if
you said you two were brothers.

00:42:52.117 --> 00:42:54.418
Hey, meet me at the ice
cream shop after school.

00:42:54.758 --> 00:42:55.918
The ice cream shop? Why?

00:42:56.318 --> 00:42:58.057
You asked me to find you a part-time job.

00:42:58.628 --> 00:42:59.787
You already found me a job?

00:43:00.227 --> 00:43:02.326
I'll let the manager
know, so don't be late.

00:43:02.327 --> 00:43:04.227
Okay. Good luck with the audition.

00:43:13.137 --> 00:43:14.177
Hey.

00:43:14.608 --> 00:43:15.807
It's my expression of love.

00:43:23.017 --> 00:43:24.616
- More. Yes, that's it.
- Like this?

00:43:24.617 --> 00:43:27.457
- Hey, guys.
- Bounce.

00:43:27.458 --> 00:43:29.257
- Pull.
- Bounce.

00:43:29.258 --> 00:43:31.488
Hey, nice one.

00:43:34.298 --> 00:43:35.327
He looks like he's losing his mind.

00:43:36.028 --> 00:43:38.267
How could he be in his right mind
when Se Gyeong left to study abroad?

00:43:38.697 --> 00:43:40.467
I heard she left without
even saying goodbye.

00:43:40.468 --> 00:43:43.197
Of course, he already
lost his mind. You know?

00:43:44.307 --> 00:43:45.707
Hey, let's try it once more.

00:43:45.708 --> 00:43:49.778
- Okay.
- Bounce.

00:43:53.347 --> 00:43:54.517
What did you just say?

00:43:55.878 --> 00:43:56.918
Who...

00:43:58.318 --> 00:43:59.387
went where?

00:44:50.137 --> 00:44:51.137
Go!

00:44:52.608 --> 00:44:53.778
Yes!

00:45:17.827 --> 00:45:18.898
Gosh, it's so ugly.

00:45:39.447 --> 00:45:41.358
(White Night)

00:46:24.727 --> 00:46:27.938
Me?

00:46:37.048 --> 00:46:38.108
You're looking for a guitar, right?

00:46:38.708 --> 00:46:40.718
What kind? Folk? Electric?

00:46:41.318 --> 00:46:43.218
- Or classical?
- Folk.

00:46:43.688 --> 00:46:44.787
Which one?

00:46:45.117 --> 00:46:48.358
A dreadnought with a low saddle.

00:46:48.617 --> 00:46:50.057
With a pickup already installed.

00:46:52.227 --> 00:46:53.258
I have a good one for you.

00:46:53.358 --> 00:46:55.357
I'll go get it now. Give me a moment.

00:46:55.358 --> 00:46:56.657
Wait, sir.

00:46:57.128 --> 00:46:59.628
Would it be okay if I just
took a look at it today?

00:47:00.267 --> 00:47:01.798
Today's my first day at my part-time job.

00:47:03.637 --> 00:47:04.938
I'll come back and buy it soon.

00:47:05.208 --> 00:47:06.267
Sure, no problem.

00:47:07.407 --> 00:47:08.707
It's for you, right?

00:47:08.708 --> 00:47:11.307
No. I want to get it for my dad.

00:47:12.247 --> 00:47:13.818
We're in the same band.

00:47:14.077 --> 00:47:16.817
My gosh. Your dad is very cool.

00:47:16.818 --> 00:47:18.347
He started a band with his son?

00:47:21.287 --> 00:47:23.157
- Feel free to browse around.
- Thank you.

00:47:32.927 --> 00:47:33.938
Choi Se Gyeong?

00:47:35.197 --> 00:47:37.508
- Oh, this... This is it.
- That's so cool.

00:47:38.438 --> 00:47:39.507
- Look at that.
- Isn't that the album?

00:47:39.508 --> 00:47:41.377
- This is so pretty.
- It's five dollars.

00:47:41.378 --> 00:47:42.577
It suits you perfectly.

00:47:42.677 --> 00:47:44.507
- A dollar?
- Seriously? A dollar?

00:47:44.508 --> 00:47:45.647
- Shall I just buy it?
- Hold on.

00:47:45.648 --> 00:47:48.176
All right. The shoes finally
found its perfect owner.

00:47:48.177 --> 00:47:49.346
I hope you get a lot of use out of them.

00:47:49.347 --> 00:47:51.587
- Are you sure they're authentic?
- Yes, of course.

00:47:51.588 --> 00:47:53.858
If you want to make sure, take
them to the boutique and ask.

00:47:54.188 --> 00:47:55.717
You're selling them so cheap.

00:47:55.718 --> 00:47:57.927
- I hope you sell a lot of things.
- Thank you. Have a good day.

00:48:00.298 --> 00:48:01.628
This is quite lucrative.

00:48:02.097 --> 00:48:03.157
Let's see.

00:48:07.137 --> 00:48:08.137
Choi Se Gyeong?

00:48:11.267 --> 00:48:13.238
- You are Choi Se Gyeong.
- No, I'm not.

00:48:18.008 --> 00:48:19.707
It is you. Don't you know who I am?

00:48:19.708 --> 00:48:20.718
Gosh.

00:48:21.177 --> 00:48:22.547
Do I have to know who you are?

00:48:22.548 --> 00:48:24.717
It's fine even if you don't remember me,

00:48:24.718 --> 00:48:27.016
but I must know why you're here.

00:48:27.017 --> 00:48:28.087
Can't you see?

00:48:28.088 --> 00:48:29.857
I'm selling my stuff at this flea market.

00:48:29.858 --> 00:48:31.826
That wasn't my question.

00:48:31.827 --> 00:48:33.027
You moved to the US without saying goodbye.

00:48:33.028 --> 00:48:34.326
You're not supposed to come back,

00:48:34.327 --> 00:48:35.926
but you came back, and you're here now.

00:48:35.927 --> 00:48:37.926
What is going on?

00:48:37.927 --> 00:48:38.927
Who said...

00:48:39.197 --> 00:48:40.867
I wasn't supposed to come back?

00:48:42.197 --> 00:48:43.237
What?

00:48:43.238 --> 00:48:44.938
Is there a reason I shouldn't come back?

00:48:46.008 --> 00:48:47.008
No.

00:48:51.907 --> 00:48:53.108
Would you say you're athletic?

00:48:53.208 --> 00:48:54.918
"Athletic?" Why?

00:48:55.778 --> 00:48:57.117
How fast can you run 100m?

00:48:57.318 --> 00:48:58.616
I usually hear lines
like this in a drama...

00:48:58.617 --> 00:49:00.358
right before they run away.

00:49:00.718 --> 00:49:01.787
Bingo.

00:49:04.128 --> 00:49:05.258
Pack up quickly!

00:49:07.128 --> 00:49:08.128
Pack up.

00:49:08.827 --> 00:49:11.197
- You think that'd make me run?
- You'll have to run...

00:49:11.468 --> 00:49:13.468
because you want to
know why I'm back in Korea.

00:49:14.997 --> 00:49:16.167
Pack up everything you see here...

00:49:16.168 --> 00:49:18.108
and meet me at the snack
shop over there in 30 minutes.

00:49:18.568 --> 00:49:19.568
You can do it.

00:49:19.569 --> 00:49:21.738
Hey. Darn it.

00:49:22.108 --> 00:49:23.137
Shoot.

00:49:23.407 --> 00:49:24.577
Hey, what am I supposed to do?

00:49:25.947 --> 00:49:27.977
- My goodness.
- Clean this up now!

00:49:31.188 --> 00:49:33.517
Yi Chan, that idiot, must
be so anxious right now.

00:49:33.988 --> 00:49:35.717
Who knows? Miracles can happen.

00:49:35.718 --> 00:49:37.426
Come on. Don't talk like an amateur.

00:49:37.427 --> 00:49:39.527
Hey, such a miracle
cannot happen in three days.

00:49:39.528 --> 00:49:41.056
Then why did you say
you wanted to audition him?

00:49:41.057 --> 00:49:42.057
What a hassle.

00:49:42.497 --> 00:49:44.527
Because we need a reason.

00:49:44.528 --> 00:49:47.668
A pretext for firing Yi Chan
and finding a new front man.

00:49:48.197 --> 00:49:50.767
Look at you. You're so clever.

00:49:53.938 --> 00:49:54.938
What?

00:49:55.608 --> 00:49:57.648
Where's this coming
from? Who can sing so well?

00:50:00.208 --> 00:50:01.278
- The band room!
- The band room!

00:50:01.418 --> 00:50:02.476
Let's go.

00:50:02.477 --> 00:50:04.648
I couldn't bring myself to face you

00:50:08.188 --> 00:50:13.128
I cried so much

00:50:15.398 --> 00:50:20.097
Getting soaked in the rain

00:50:22.767 --> 00:50:27.438
Crying in the rain

00:50:30.608 --> 00:50:35.977
You in the rain

00:50:37.347 --> 00:50:42.318
Picturing a faint image of you

00:50:44.387 --> 00:50:49.128
Our last words

00:50:51.827 --> 00:50:56.137
And your last words

00:51:01.208 --> 00:51:06.677
I love you

00:51:08.278 --> 00:51:15.418
I love you

00:51:15.617 --> 00:51:23.227
I love you

00:51:32.168 --> 00:51:33.208
- You passed the audition.
- You passed the audition.

00:51:43.048 --> 00:51:45.386
Hey, thanks.

00:51:45.387 --> 00:51:46.818
You got everything, right?

00:51:47.787 --> 00:51:49.557
Tell me why you're back in Korea.

00:51:53.327 --> 00:51:55.497
I came back because...

00:51:58.427 --> 00:52:00.326
I took the flight back to Korea!

00:52:00.327 --> 00:52:01.968
- Hey!
- Are we good now? Bye, I'm off.

00:52:03.197 --> 00:52:05.737
I never liked you anyway,
but you really are the worst.

00:52:05.738 --> 00:52:07.676
Don't you feel bad for Yi Chan at all?

00:52:07.677 --> 00:52:09.076
You're the reason he started the band,

00:52:09.077 --> 00:52:11.407
and he's practicing so hard
day and night because of you.

00:52:11.477 --> 00:52:13.407
How could you leave without a word?

00:52:13.847 --> 00:52:15.777
Was it fun to make a complete fool of him?

00:52:15.778 --> 00:52:17.287
Do you feel better about yourself now?

00:52:18.148 --> 00:52:19.188
You're right.

00:52:19.918 --> 00:52:21.157
I am at fault.

00:52:24.657 --> 00:52:27.197
Come on. I'll buy you a cold drink.

00:52:31.997 --> 00:52:33.028
Darn it.

00:52:33.597 --> 00:52:36.266
You shouldn't have tortured him
by giving him hope in the first place.

00:52:36.267 --> 00:52:37.306
Upon deciding to study abroad,

00:52:37.307 --> 00:52:39.306
you should've told him the
truth and made him give up.

00:52:39.307 --> 00:52:40.507
Even if you think he's a pushover,

00:52:40.508 --> 00:52:41.938
you should still be respectful
to him at the very least.

00:52:42.037 --> 00:52:44.307
- Am I wrong?
- You're right.

00:52:44.447 --> 00:52:46.877
Gosh, what a meanie.

00:52:46.878 --> 00:52:47.918
Hey!

00:52:49.677 --> 00:52:50.886
I'm talking about you right now.

00:52:50.887 --> 00:52:51.918
Exactly.

00:52:52.048 --> 00:52:54.718
I feel really bad after hearing
everything you just said.

00:52:55.758 --> 00:52:58.087
I should meet Yi Chan...

00:52:58.088 --> 00:52:59.287
- and apologize in person.
- No!

00:53:00.287 --> 00:53:01.958
Do not show up in front
of Yi Chan ever again.

00:53:04.727 --> 00:53:05.867
So there's something.

00:53:06.898 --> 00:53:07.938
What do you mean?

00:53:08.597 --> 00:53:10.397
A reason I shouldn't come back.

00:53:10.398 --> 00:53:12.036
A reason I shouldn't meet Yi Chan.

00:53:12.037 --> 00:53:13.108
Whatever.

00:53:13.168 --> 00:53:14.837
Just keep your promise. It's your turn now.

00:53:14.838 --> 00:53:16.907
Tell me. Why did you come back?

00:53:17.878 --> 00:53:19.548
Are you sure you can handle it?

00:53:19.677 --> 00:53:21.616
My story is very unrealistic.

00:53:21.617 --> 00:53:22.878
You'll find it hard to believe.

00:53:24.247 --> 00:53:25.747
It can't be more unrealistic than mine.

00:53:27.048 --> 00:53:28.418
I can handle it. Go ahead and tell me.

00:53:29.517 --> 00:53:30.557
I came back to die.

00:53:31.488 --> 00:53:34.057
Upon arriving in the US, I found
out my dad had another woman.

00:53:34.398 --> 00:53:36.726
My mom's like a walking time
bomb. She is about to explode.

00:53:36.727 --> 00:53:39.128
Very soon, she's going
to start drinking again.

00:53:39.267 --> 00:53:41.596
Then naturally, she'll become
more obsessed with me,

00:53:41.597 --> 00:53:43.537
and I'll have to live like her puppet.

00:53:44.338 --> 00:53:45.668
So I ran away and came back.

00:53:46.338 --> 00:53:47.378
To die.

00:53:48.137 --> 00:53:49.208
To put an end to all of it.

00:53:49.938 --> 00:53:51.577
- Oh, I just...
- But...

00:53:53.077 --> 00:53:54.447
something unexpected has happened.

00:53:54.718 --> 00:53:55.847
Something very interesting.

00:53:57.648 --> 00:53:59.918
So I'm debating whether I should
live a few more days and see.

00:54:02.287 --> 00:54:05.528
So don't tell anyone that you saw me.

00:54:05.958 --> 00:54:06.988
Unless you want to die.

00:54:23.338 --> 00:54:24.447
I'm sorry.

00:54:30.847 --> 00:54:32.148
I'm here.

00:54:34.258 --> 00:54:35.487
My goodness.

00:54:35.488 --> 00:54:38.327
You're always cheerful. Why
do you seem so out of it today?

00:54:38.628 --> 00:54:40.758
Do you no longer manipulate
girls' first love memories?

00:54:42.528 --> 00:54:44.627
The girl I had a crush on has moved away.

00:54:44.628 --> 00:54:47.297
Oh, right. That girl!

00:54:47.298 --> 00:54:49.668
Hey, the girl who just left...

00:54:49.838 --> 00:54:52.307
is the one who dropped
off the invitation for you.

00:54:52.407 --> 00:54:53.977
Did you not see her? You
wanted to know who it was.

00:54:58.907 --> 00:55:01.247
Hey. Shoot. I don't know her name.

00:55:01.617 --> 00:55:04.017
Hey, you! The supply room
at Seowon Arts High School!

00:55:05.088 --> 00:55:06.117
Hey!

00:55:14.727 --> 00:55:15.898
You remember me, right?

00:55:20.838 --> 00:55:21.867
This.

00:55:24.108 --> 00:55:25.208
Was this from you?

00:55:34.648 --> 00:55:35.917
And you wrote this?

00:55:35.918 --> 00:55:37.218
(From Se Gyeong)

00:55:40.688 --> 00:55:41.758
Why?

00:55:43.188 --> 00:55:44.627
Why did you write this fake letter?

00:55:44.628 --> 00:55:46.927
I am asking you why you
had to make a total fool of me!

00:55:48.628 --> 00:55:49.858
Why? Do you think I'm a joke?

00:55:50.458 --> 00:55:51.596
Did you think I was pathetic...

00:55:51.597 --> 00:55:54.367
for chasing the prettiest girl at
your school when I was a nobody?

00:55:55.137 --> 00:55:56.468
So you pranked me like this?

00:55:57.037 --> 00:55:58.807
Is that why you messed with me like this?

00:56:00.838 --> 00:56:02.238
If that's the case, congratulations.

00:56:02.608 --> 00:56:03.677
Your prank totally worked.

00:56:03.907 --> 00:56:05.247
Thanks to you,

00:56:05.847 --> 00:56:07.977
Se Gyeong thinks I'm the biggest loser.

00:56:09.218 --> 00:56:10.418
Are you happy now?

00:56:11.218 --> 00:56:12.517
Answer me.

00:56:13.418 --> 00:56:15.758
It's rude not to answer when
someone's talking to you.

00:56:16.258 --> 00:56:18.028
Are you happy now?

00:56:24.927 --> 00:56:26.427
Hey, it's dangerous.
There's a car behind you.

00:56:27.668 --> 00:56:29.438
It's dangerous. There's
a car right behind you!

00:56:39.878 --> 00:56:40.977
Have you lost your mind?

00:56:41.378 --> 00:56:43.318
You need to step aside
when there's a car behind you.

00:56:43.847 --> 00:56:45.347
Do your ears not work?

00:56:46.718 --> 00:56:48.517
Are you deaf or something?

00:56:53.927 --> 00:56:54.958
Hey.

00:56:56.958 --> 00:56:58.168
She's so rude.

00:57:06.108 --> 00:57:07.367
Hey, you didn't meet her?

00:57:07.878 --> 00:57:09.537
I did.

00:57:09.807 --> 00:57:10.947
And I regret meeting her.

00:57:11.177 --> 00:57:13.307
- I wish I hadn't met her.
- Why do you say that?

00:57:13.847 --> 00:57:15.718
She won't answer any of my questions.

00:57:15.818 --> 00:57:18.048
I helped her in the past, but
she never once thanked me.

00:57:18.247 --> 00:57:19.887
She always ignores me.

00:57:20.387 --> 00:57:22.786
I've never seen someone so rude.

00:57:22.787 --> 00:57:24.088
Yi Chan, you didn't know?

00:57:24.988 --> 00:57:25.988
What?

00:57:26.287 --> 00:57:27.528
She can't hear.

00:58:14.238 --> 00:58:15.838
Do your ears not work?

00:58:17.077 --> 00:58:18.878
Are you deaf or something?

00:58:23.918 --> 00:58:25.488
Sir, I'll be right back.

00:58:53.778 --> 00:58:55.017
It's so odd.

00:58:55.977 --> 00:58:58.047
She clearly told me she
never once visited Korea...

00:58:58.048 --> 00:59:00.117
until she heard Mr. Viva had passed away.

00:59:00.347 --> 00:59:01.588
I came back to die.

00:59:02.157 --> 00:59:03.918
- Oh, I just...
- But...

00:59:05.988 --> 00:59:07.327
something unexpected has happened.

00:59:07.557 --> 00:59:09.858
What is it? What could it be?

00:59:10.927 --> 00:59:11.967
It doesn't matter.

00:59:11.968 --> 00:59:13.628
I just need to make sure
Dad's accident doesn't happen.

00:59:14.028 --> 00:59:16.668
Dad, how did you and Mom meet?

00:59:21.537 --> 00:59:24.977
I met her in a sign language
class when I was 20.

00:59:25.508 --> 00:59:27.278
I went there to learn sign language...

00:59:27.378 --> 00:59:29.177
and fell in love with your
mom the moment I saw her.

00:59:31.218 --> 00:59:33.617
Why? Because of her face?

00:59:34.017 --> 00:59:36.887
Sure, I thought she looked pretty.
But it was because of her voice.

00:59:38.188 --> 00:59:39.258
Her voice?

00:59:39.988 --> 00:59:42.958
Her sign language
gestures looked so pretty.

00:59:43.458 --> 00:59:45.668
That's her voice, you know.

00:59:48.767 --> 00:59:51.938
Hold on. Dad had to learn sign language...

00:59:52.438 --> 00:59:54.438
because he lost his
hearing due to the accident.

00:59:55.477 --> 00:59:56.976
If I stop the accident from happening,

00:59:56.977 --> 00:59:58.508
he won't need to learn it,

00:59:58.878 --> 01:00:01.148
which means he and Mom
won't meet in that class.

01:00:02.177 --> 01:00:03.747
Then Eun Ho and I won't be born...

01:00:04.488 --> 01:00:06.886
Oh, no. I must find Mom no matter what,

01:00:06.887 --> 01:00:08.517
so they can meet sooner.

01:00:20.168 --> 01:00:22.068
Take this. You'll catch a cold.

01:01:24.867 --> 01:01:25.927
I came too late.

01:01:28.238 --> 01:01:29.338
I came too late.

01:01:31.267 --> 01:01:32.338
Se Gyeong.

01:01:32.438 --> 01:01:34.938
Hi. It's been a while, Yi Chan.

01:01:39.108 --> 01:01:41.048
Se Gyeong is back.

01:01:41.778 --> 01:01:43.847
(Bestin Rabbit Thirty Seven Ice Cream)

01:01:47.148 --> 01:01:51.188
(When life gives you
lemons, make lemonade.)

01:01:52.827 --> 01:01:55.697
(Special thanks to Park Ho
San and Oh Hyeon Gyeong)

01:02:22.787 --> 01:02:27.458
(Twinkling Watermelon)

01:02:27.557 --> 01:02:30.757
If I hadn't let Se Gyeong
borrow that T-shirt,

01:02:30.758 --> 01:02:33.096
would I have been the
one standing before you?

01:02:33.097 --> 01:02:34.366
Yi Chan, hi!

01:02:34.367 --> 01:02:35.866
Are you really the Choi Se Gyeong I know?

01:02:35.867 --> 01:02:38.007
It's crazy that we have to change
the song because of what she said.

01:02:38.008 --> 01:02:39.766
I'll give Se Gyeong everything she wants.

01:02:39.767 --> 01:02:41.207
Is our band a joke to you?

01:02:41.208 --> 01:02:42.636
Fine, then I'll leave.

01:02:42.637 --> 01:02:44.107
Don't do anything you'll regret later.

01:02:44.108 --> 01:02:45.877
If you leave like this,
I won't take you back!

01:02:45.878 --> 01:02:48.417
So? Have you found out
the reason you're here?

01:02:48.418 --> 01:02:50.777
Forget it. Everything's just a mess.

01:02:50.778 --> 01:02:52.217
Nothing is going my way.

01:02:52.218 --> 01:02:54.687
The moment you arrived here,

01:02:54.688 --> 01:02:57.157
everything started to change.
