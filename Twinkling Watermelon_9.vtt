00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:52.960

(Staff ensured child actors'
safety in the filming of this drama.)

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:56.629
One, two.

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:58.829
One, two, three, four.

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:01.530
(Episode 9)

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.920
When I gaze at the
setting sun, tinged with red

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.550
The sad look on your face comes to my mind

00:01:21.949 --> 00:01:25.490
I sink my head, and tears fall down

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.228
There's nothing I can say

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.100
- But the truth is that I love you
- But the truth is that I love you

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:34.699
- You are my world - You are my world

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.138
- I'm screaming that to the world
- I'm screaming that to the world

00:01:38.139 --> 00:01:42.309
- But the setting sun burns silently
- But the setting sun burns silently

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.739
- The truth is that I love you
- The truth is that I love you

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:46.778
- Ha Eun Gyeol!
- Ha Eun Gyeol!

00:01:46.779 --> 00:01:49.409
- You are my world - You are my world

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:50.410
- Ha Eun Gyeol!
- Ha Eun Gyeol!

00:01:50.411 --> 00:01:52.978
- I'm screaming that to the world
- I'm screaming that to the world

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.149
- But the setting sun burns silently
- But the setting sun burns silently

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.789
(Come back to us, Ha Eun Gyeol!)

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:10.330
Welcome back, Eun Gyeol.

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.100
I've been waiting for a long time.

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.940
How did you know I was here?

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:17.470
Se Gyeong told me.

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:22.149
Eun Gyeol.

00:02:23.149 --> 00:02:24.480
I'm sorry.

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:27.689
From now on, I'll do my best...

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:29.819
for the band, to study,

00:02:30.219 --> 00:02:31.760
and to keep all of my promises to you.

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:35.230
You might think you're
wasting your time with me.

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.330
But I'll try to make it worth your time.

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:40.230
I'll do my best...

00:02:40.899 --> 00:02:42.499
not to waste your time and to improve.

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:45.339
So come back to us.

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.339
You're the only guitarist for
First Love Memory Manipulators.

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.059
- Fine. Let's do it.
- Really?

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.658
You mean it, right? You
can't back out now! Okay?

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:11.158
- Under one condition.
- Yes. What is it?

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:13.499
Tell me anything you want.
I'll make it happen for you.

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:15.430
Stop seeing Choi Se Gyeong.

00:03:19.469 --> 00:03:20.469
What?

00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:25.409
If you don't, we can't play together...

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:27.510
because...

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:30.309
Because?

00:03:31.249 --> 00:03:32.879
I like Choi Se Gyeong.

00:03:35.589 --> 00:03:37.760
(Come back to us, Ha Eun Gyeol!)

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:39.460
So choose.

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:41.159
Me or her?

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:49.830
Answer me.

00:03:51.869 --> 00:03:52.899
I don't want to.

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.140
- You don't want to?
- No.

00:03:57.439 --> 00:03:58.839
I don't want to choose, you jerk.

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:00.480
What are you going to do?

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.479
- They're fighting!
- They're going to fight!

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:04.618
What did you say?

00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:06.119
- Hey, calm down.
- You want me to choose?

00:04:06.219 --> 00:04:07.379
- You want me to stop seeing her?
- Hey.

00:04:07.619 --> 00:04:09.389
- What are you doing?
- You like whom?

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:11.088
- Hey, come here.
- Let go of him.

00:04:11.089 --> 00:04:12.419
You had no place to go!

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.989
I gave you clothes, food,
and a place to sleep! Darn it.

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:16.729
How could you stab
me in the back like this?

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:19.899
Hey, how could you do this to me?

00:04:20.059 --> 00:04:21.528
How could you?

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:23.899
The food wasn't from
you. Your grandma fed me!

00:04:25.069 --> 00:04:27.540
- What did you say, you jerk?
- I'm doing this for you!

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:29.670
I'm doing it for your own good!

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.740
Okay. Bal San, okay.

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:35.650
- Okay.
- Gosh.

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:37.879
I'm really okay.

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:41.349
- Hey!
- Hey, stop it.

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:42.649
You're going to betray
me and then do me a favor?

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:43.948
- You think this is a joke?
- Hey.

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:45.920
- Hey, that's enough.
- Get your hands off me!

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:49.660
Yi Chan, are you all right?

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:51.459
Are you hurt badly?

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.429
- Hey, his nose is bleeding.
- Oh, no.

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:58.998
- You got a nosebleed.
- It's a nosebleed.

00:04:58.999 --> 00:05:00.999
- Both of his nostrils are bleeding.
- Yi Chan!

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:04.109
Are you all right? Oh, no. You
got a nosebleed! This is bad.

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:05.480
Does it hurt a lot?

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:07.540
What do you think, you jerk?

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:17.650
Let go of me!

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:38.009
Stop it. Please that's enough!

00:05:40.009 --> 00:05:41.040
Hey, it's Choi Se Gyeong!

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:43.680
- Hey, let's go.
- It's Choi Se Gyeong!

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:45.448
My cap!

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:47.350
- Hey, Se Gyeong.
- Oh, no!

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:49.748
- Hey!
- Hey, it's her.

00:05:49.749 --> 00:05:51.920
- Se Gyeong.
- What's going on?

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.569
- Hey, get on that.
- Get on that already.

00:06:04.129 --> 00:06:06.699
- Hey, hop on.
- Hurry up.

00:06:06.939 --> 00:06:08.839
- Get on it.
- Hey, where are you going?

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:09.969
Darn it. Hurry up!

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:11.308
We need to settle this!

00:06:11.309 --> 00:06:12.910
Come on. Get on the truck already!

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:14.879
Hurry up.

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:16.850
Look who it is.

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:19.019
I recognize you.

00:06:22.619 --> 00:06:25.689
Darn it. People will
recognize me without the cap.

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:39.400
Move! Hey, stop right there!

00:06:54.079 --> 00:06:55.119
- Hurry.
- Hey.

00:06:55.889 --> 00:06:57.449
- Come on. Hop on it.
- Hey.

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:02.930
Wait.

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:06.959
- Hey!
- Grab my hand!

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:19.309
Okay.

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:00.150
(Outdoor swimming pool)

00:08:10.459 --> 00:08:11.629
These punks.

00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:13.230
Where are they?

00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:14.530
Are they here?

00:08:34.650 --> 00:08:36.019
- Are you okay?
- Darn it.

00:08:36.449 --> 00:08:39.089
What is this? What do
you think you're doing?

00:08:39.090 --> 00:08:41.159
It looked like you were in a tight spot...

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:42.589
like you didn't want the
school to know you were here.

00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:44.628
- I was just trying to help.
- Not that.

00:08:44.629 --> 00:08:45.699
Not that?

00:08:48.069 --> 00:08:50.069
I'm sorry about earlier.

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:53.099
It wasn't nice of me to share
my feelings in front of everyone.

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:55.039
I would like to apologize politely.

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:57.369
That's a form of violence.
Did you know that?

00:08:57.370 --> 00:08:58.479
I'm sorry.

00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:02.709
I'll accept your apology. Go on.

00:09:03.849 --> 00:09:05.079
Is there more?

00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:10.619
How I said I liked you?

00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:12.958
Yes. That! There's no way you
actually have feelings for me.

00:09:12.959 --> 00:09:15.430
Are you kidding me?
You like Yi Chan, not me.

00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:16.659
How many times...

00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:17.930
- must I say that's not true?
- Shut your mouth!

00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:19.958
You used me as your beard,
so you wouldn't get outed.

00:09:19.959 --> 00:09:21.468
You used me like a tool to pretend...

00:09:21.469 --> 00:09:22.698
you like girls.

00:09:22.699 --> 00:09:24.399
I'm your protection like the airbag.

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:26.770
You used me as a bulletproof
vest to lie like a coward.

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:28.140
It's impossible to win
an argument against her.

00:09:28.469 --> 00:09:29.969
Ms. Choi was a modern woman.

00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:31.880
Do you realize what you have done wrong?

00:09:31.979 --> 00:09:33.308
My mission starts now.

00:09:33.309 --> 00:09:34.478
It wasn't a lie. I meant it.

00:09:34.479 --> 00:09:35.978
I really like you a lot.

00:09:35.979 --> 00:09:38.649
So if possible, I hope you like me
back and become very fond of me.

00:09:38.650 --> 00:09:41.750
What's this? It feels
like I'm talking to an AI.

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:44.959
What's this? It feels like I'm being
examined under the microscope.

00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:46.359
Did she figure it out?

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:48.260
I'll give you three seconds.

00:09:48.329 --> 00:09:49.659
Tell me why you like me...

00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:51.558
and when you started to like
me in these given three seconds.

00:09:51.559 --> 00:09:52.629
It's a ten-point open-ended question.

00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:53.630
Unless you want to die,

00:09:53.631 --> 00:09:55.370
you'd better give me an answer
as wise as Solomon's solution.

00:09:55.569 --> 00:09:57.169
- One.
- I'm in trouble.

00:09:57.170 --> 00:09:58.170
What should I say?

00:09:58.469 --> 00:09:59.469
Two.

00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:00.739
It looks like she's ready to kill me.

00:10:01.099 --> 00:10:02.969
If I say the wrong thing, I
really might end up dead.

00:10:04.739 --> 00:10:06.338
- Three.
- It was the first time I saw you.

00:10:06.339 --> 00:10:07.410
It was like fate.

00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:09.150
You were too pretty.

00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:13.949
I'm doomed. It won't work, right?

00:10:14.719 --> 00:10:15.719
Mission clear.

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:17.150
What? This worked?

00:10:17.989 --> 00:10:19.089
You punk.

00:10:20.589 --> 00:10:21.959
You have real feelings for me.

00:10:22.059 --> 00:10:23.829
What? Why was that so easy?

00:10:24.130 --> 00:10:25.459
Was she really the queen of the school?

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.099
Oh, my.

00:10:28.569 --> 00:10:31.069
I see. You were in here.

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:33.699
You punks.

00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:42.349
How am I supposed to understand this?

00:10:43.349 --> 00:10:44.780
This is your first day at school.

00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:46.478
Yet, you brought in students
from another school...

00:10:46.479 --> 00:10:48.989
and fought over a girl. Talk
about some recklessness.

00:10:49.390 --> 00:10:51.050
You were supposed to be studying abroad.

00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:52.519
Why are you standing...

00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:54.620
in my office with this troublemaker?

00:10:55.729 --> 00:10:56.930
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

00:10:57.559 --> 00:10:58.800
Do you know each other?

00:10:59.130 --> 00:11:00.260
- No.
- Yes.

00:11:01.359 --> 00:11:02.370
What are you doing?

00:11:05.069 --> 00:11:06.140
- Yes.
- No.

00:11:07.439 --> 00:11:08.709
- Gosh.
- What?

00:11:11.069 --> 00:11:12.109
Is this funny?

00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:14.380
Do you think this is a joke?

00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:19.078
(Seowon Arts High School)

00:11:19.079 --> 00:11:21.380
The bell rang. Go back
to your class for now.

00:11:21.719 --> 00:11:22.719
As for what happened today,

00:11:23.449 --> 00:11:25.019
based on the decision of
the Guidance Committee,

00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:27.020
you'll face appropriate
punishment. That's all.

00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:28.790
Okay.

00:11:30.689 --> 00:11:31.930
Se Gyeong, you stay.

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:34.799
- Really?
- No way.

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:36.329
- Are you sure?
- Seriously?

00:11:42.569 --> 00:11:44.140
Sorry. I'm late.

00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:47.708
Chung Ah.

00:11:47.709 --> 00:11:49.849
- What's going on?
- Hey, what's happening?

00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:51.818
- What was that?
- Is there a love triangle?

00:11:51.819 --> 00:11:52.920
- Oh, no.
- Look.

00:11:55.949 --> 00:11:57.050
So let me get this straight.

00:11:57.620 --> 00:12:00.689
You started to hear ringing
in your ears all of a sudden.

00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:02.929
The local doctor said...

00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:04.228
it was probably because
of your long flight...

00:12:04.229 --> 00:12:05.800
and was only temporary.

00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:08.568
But you came back to Korea to
get a thorough medical exam...

00:12:08.569 --> 00:12:10.170
just in case. Did I get it right?

00:12:10.329 --> 00:12:11.329
Yes.

00:12:11.770 --> 00:12:13.969
Ma'am, you know how my mom is.

00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:16.909
Even the smallest thing worries her.

00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:18.309
Yes! That's it.

00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:21.650
Gosh. I can never get my
way with my stubborn mother.

00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:24.750
But why would someone like
her allow you to travel alone?

00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:26.979
Well,

00:12:27.819 --> 00:12:29.549
I have my uncle here.

00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:31.818
I'll get examined at his hospital.

00:12:31.819 --> 00:12:32.890
Thatâ€™s why they let me come to Korea alone.

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:34.760
- Is that so?
- Yes.

00:12:34.959 --> 00:12:36.558
I'm glad to hear that you have
someone looking after you.

00:12:36.559 --> 00:12:37.589
Right.

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:39.160
Go ahead.

00:12:46.569 --> 00:12:48.770
Good grief. Is she a profiler or what?

00:12:49.010 --> 00:12:50.770
She's making me super nervous. Seriously.

00:12:52.609 --> 00:12:55.449
Then does it mean you will
postpone your studies abroad?

00:12:55.709 --> 00:12:58.078
No. I just have to pass
the language course.

00:12:58.079 --> 00:13:00.319
I can go back to the US
before the master course begins.

00:13:00.819 --> 00:13:01.819
I see.

00:13:08.959 --> 00:13:10.260
I hope you won't take it personally.

00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:12.630
It's not that I don't believe you.

00:13:13.059 --> 00:13:15.370
I'm just trying to fulfill my duty.

00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:17.900
Gosh. Are you going to call them?

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:21.039
My parents are traveling
in Canada right now.

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:22.339
They won't answer their phones.

00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:26.410
Go and drink your tea.

00:13:27.939 --> 00:13:30.750
This is bad. What if Mom answers the phone?

00:13:31.209 --> 00:13:34.020
My family is traveling Canada right now.

00:13:34.079 --> 00:13:35.448
- Nice!
- If you need to reach us,

00:13:35.449 --> 00:13:38.290
- please leave a message.
- Good job remembering that.

00:13:39.189 --> 00:13:42.189
Let's talk again once your
parents come back from their trip.

00:13:43.329 --> 00:13:45.058
I'll arrange things at school,

00:13:45.059 --> 00:13:47.000
so you can attend our school
before you have to go back.

00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:50.300
What? Why must I come back?

00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:52.269
You don't have to do that.

00:13:52.270 --> 00:13:53.339
You.

00:13:57.809 --> 00:13:59.040
Are you Choi Se Gyeong?

00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:01.040
What?

00:14:02.209 --> 00:14:04.079
What do you mean?

00:14:04.309 --> 00:14:06.379
An ordinary girl who
doesn't feel bad about...

00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:07.949
wasting her youth would have that attitude.

00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:10.620
But the Choi Se Gyeong I know...

00:14:10.949 --> 00:14:12.989
would want the same thing as me.

00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:16.290
Isn't that why you came to school?

00:14:18.089 --> 00:14:20.959
Bingo! You're the best.

00:14:21.969 --> 00:14:23.170
We're on the same page.

00:14:25.439 --> 00:14:28.269
Darn it. Why do I have
to go to school in 1995?

00:14:28.270 --> 00:14:29.839
After all, I time traveled here.

00:14:37.079 --> 00:14:38.150
Chung Ah.

00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:40.150
Don't be mad at me, please.

00:14:41.050 --> 00:14:42.719
Why don't you hit me instead?

00:14:42.949 --> 00:14:44.489
Use your anger to hit me.

00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:46.290
Hit me...

00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:48.020
until you feel better. Okay?

00:14:48.219 --> 00:14:50.459
Please forgive me just this once.

00:14:50.559 --> 00:14:52.058
Please. Just this once.

00:14:52.059 --> 00:14:53.729
What's his deal?

00:14:54.530 --> 00:14:57.129
He told the entire school he
liked me. How can he act like that?

00:14:57.130 --> 00:14:58.199
Please don't be angry.

00:14:58.699 --> 00:15:00.900
Please, Chung Ah. Just this once.

00:15:21.790 --> 00:15:23.130
Assume the position again.

00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:28.930
How could you barge in there?

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.800
Did you go there to disgrace our school?

00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:35.809
You ought to carry on
with your failed lives quietly.

00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:38.578
Why did you make a
scene in our entire district...

00:15:38.579 --> 00:15:40.239
like loaches mudding the water, you punks?

00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:44.780
You're the problem. You know?

00:15:45.010 --> 00:15:47.279
Since you gave up on going to college,

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:48.620
you don't care. Is that it?

00:15:49.349 --> 00:15:51.049
Are you doing whatever you
want because you have no parents,

00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:52.620
fretting over you?

00:15:57.229 --> 00:15:58.760
- Gosh, look at this punk.
- Hey.

00:15:59.030 --> 00:16:00.160
Get back on the floor.

00:16:01.699 --> 00:16:03.770
Goodness. You little...

00:16:06.339 --> 00:16:07.469
Sir,

00:16:10.010 --> 00:16:11.439
doesn't your right arm hurt?

00:16:11.939 --> 00:16:13.739
I've been worried about
your arm for a while now.

00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:16.379
You know what? Right here. I'll do it here.

00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:17.849
I'll switch sides.

00:16:18.250 --> 00:16:19.420
You can use your left arm.

00:16:20.949 --> 00:16:22.089
I love you!

00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:24.848
I do think I only used my right arm.

00:16:24.849 --> 00:16:26.059
Thank you, you punk.

00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:29.259
I can easily find it

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:31.129
- It's in my heart - It's in my heart

00:16:31.130 --> 00:16:32.858
I'll know when I close my eyes...

00:16:32.859 --> 00:16:34.058
And think quietly

00:16:34.059 --> 00:16:36.130
Hey. My part still didn't come up?

00:16:36.770 --> 00:16:39.540
- I roam around to find an angel
- I roam around to find an angel

00:16:41.699 --> 00:16:44.309
Oh, my. Look at you brooding.

00:16:44.739 --> 00:16:46.439
Why? Is it because you feel betrayed?

00:16:46.609 --> 00:16:49.349
Or did you get your
heart broken? Is that it?

00:16:49.579 --> 00:16:51.579
Se Gyeong never betrayed me.

00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:53.750
Therefore, she never broke my heart.

00:16:54.219 --> 00:16:56.290
I never said she was the one who hurt you.

00:16:57.390 --> 00:16:58.620
You probably feel...

00:16:59.189 --> 00:17:02.029
as if Ha Eun Gyeol betrayed
you and broke your heart.

00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:03.089
Do you want to die?

00:17:03.430 --> 00:17:04.828
By the way, isn't it odd?

00:17:04.829 --> 00:17:05.999
The way Ha Eun Gyeol acted earlier.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.058
Shut your mouth.

00:17:07.059 --> 00:17:09.469
He was saying things that
could hurt your feelings.

00:17:09.829 --> 00:17:11.870
But from the way he gazed at
you, he was totally on your side.

00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:16.169
I did it for you.

00:17:16.170 --> 00:17:18.340
I did it for you.

00:17:19.239 --> 00:17:20.538
Anyway,

00:17:20.539 --> 00:17:23.009
choose between Se Gyeong and Eun Gyeol.

00:17:23.279 --> 00:17:26.719
For your information, if Eun
Gyeol is out, I'm dropping out too.

00:17:27.620 --> 00:17:28.650
What?

00:17:31.989 --> 00:17:36.059
- I know how it feels to be alone
- I know how it feels to be alone

00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:39.258
- I was mistaken - I was mistaken

00:17:39.259 --> 00:17:43.329
Can you feel that the beginning of love

00:17:43.330 --> 00:17:45.899
Is the end of loneliness?

00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:48.198
I know now

00:17:48.199 --> 00:17:49.939
Chung Ah.

00:17:52.910 --> 00:17:54.239
What has been bothering you since earlier?

00:17:55.449 --> 00:17:56.749
What's the matter?

00:17:56.850 --> 00:17:58.080
What did I do wrong?

00:18:00.650 --> 00:18:01.719
Chung Ah.

00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:05.019
Chung Ah.

00:18:09.390 --> 00:18:11.360
You have serious separation anxiety.

00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:13.498
Woof. Are you a dog?

00:18:13.499 --> 00:18:14.698
Do you like anyone as
long as they're a human?

00:18:14.699 --> 00:18:16.669
Men or women. Does it not matter at all?

00:18:16.670 --> 00:18:18.399
I think you're mistaken.

00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:20.869
- Chung Ah and I are not...
- Of course, you're not.

00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:22.538
Follow me. We should go somewhere.

00:18:22.539 --> 00:18:24.769
I'm sorry, but I can't go today.

00:18:24.910 --> 00:18:27.610
You do? I should meet Yi Chan then.

00:18:28.850 --> 00:18:29.850
Yi Chan?

00:18:30.509 --> 00:18:32.620
Hey. Gosh.

00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:37.150
(Spicy Jokbal)

00:18:38.759 --> 00:18:41.420
Why do you want me to eat this so badly?

00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:43.930
You said you liked me.

00:18:43.931 --> 00:18:47.458
What does it have to do
with this lump of capsaicin?

00:18:47.459 --> 00:18:49.369
Hey. Did I tell you to pick a star...

00:18:49.370 --> 00:18:51.298
or ask you to be buried
together when I die?

00:18:51.299 --> 00:18:53.140
You can't even eat this jokbal for me?

00:18:56.370 --> 00:18:58.239
Why? Do you not want to do it?

00:18:58.570 --> 00:18:59.810
Can you not eat it because it's spicy?

00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:01.140
How should I eat it?

00:19:02.479 --> 00:19:03.548
What?

00:19:03.549 --> 00:19:05.479
You said it was important
and your life was at stake.

00:19:06.420 --> 00:19:08.180
It seems you're not entirely joking.

00:19:09.689 --> 00:19:11.149
Just because it looks trivial to me,

00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:13.390
I shouldn't ignore that
someone is desperate.

00:19:15.259 --> 00:19:18.130
I know how it feels when you have
your reasons but can't say them.

00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:23.199
How should I eat it?

00:19:23.729 --> 00:19:25.570
Should I eat it well or badly?

00:19:27.039 --> 00:19:28.910
I'll do my best to do as you want.

00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:31.670
Eat it well.

00:19:33.779 --> 00:19:36.150
No. Eat it badly.

00:19:37.479 --> 00:19:38.549
Not badly.

00:19:39.150 --> 00:19:42.590
But not well. Darn it.

00:19:42.989 --> 00:19:44.849
I don't know. Do as you want.

00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:46.489
Okay. I'll do as I want.

00:19:50.489 --> 00:19:51.560
Wait.

00:20:01.499 --> 00:20:04.810
Don't eat for now.

00:20:05.610 --> 00:20:08.439
Excuse me. Could you
pack this for me, please?

00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:14.420
Oh, my gosh.

00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:16.620
Hey.

00:20:16.789 --> 00:20:18.219
Why? What?

00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:21.090
When can I hear your answer?

00:20:21.489 --> 00:20:23.860
Answer? What answer?

00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:29.029
The answer to my confession.

00:20:31.870 --> 00:20:34.199
I want to know what you think about me.

00:20:34.739 --> 00:20:38.639
There used to be a handsome and cute dog...

00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:39.840
in my neighborhood.

00:20:40.209 --> 00:20:43.508
A dog that was a mix of
Shiba Inu and Siberian Husky.

00:20:43.509 --> 00:20:45.109
(Shiba Inu, Siberian Husky)

00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:46.180
And?

00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:48.890
You two look alike.

00:20:49.249 --> 00:20:51.150
What do you mean?

00:20:51.549 --> 00:20:53.159
Does it mean I'm cute or handsome?

00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:54.160
Shiba Sky.

00:20:54.759 --> 00:20:55.759
"Shiba?"

00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:59.458
You're nothing more than
or less than Shiba Sky.

00:20:59.459 --> 00:21:01.160
So just wait.

00:21:01.259 --> 00:21:04.129
Before I decide whether I...

00:21:04.130 --> 00:21:05.299
should give you a snack or not.

00:21:08.539 --> 00:21:09.640
This is so difficult.

00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:12.009
I don't get what she said at all.

00:21:12.810 --> 00:21:14.779
"Siberian Husky?" Did she just sweat at me?

00:21:21.449 --> 00:21:22.890
What are you, Eun Yu?

00:21:24.249 --> 00:21:26.560
It's not a big deal. Why are you
hesitating, not being able to check?

00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:32.160
But wait.

00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:34.860
How much someone can handle
spicy food is relative, isn't it?

00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:36.169
Who is the standard?

00:21:36.170 --> 00:21:37.769
How well does he have to eat it?

00:21:37.870 --> 00:21:40.139
If you think like that, Hyun Yul
who gobbled spicy chicken feet...

00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:41.499
should be a candidate
as well. Don't you think so?

00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:45.409
Goodness gracious.

00:21:45.410 --> 00:21:47.580
Why did Mom give me such a bad hint?

00:21:47.910 --> 00:21:49.309
Darn it.

00:21:49.310 --> 00:21:51.779
That's when I thought it was him.

00:21:52.850 --> 00:21:53.919
When?

00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:54.949
During the spring festival.

00:21:56.049 --> 00:21:57.548
That day,

00:21:57.549 --> 00:22:00.219
he sang a serenade for
me on stage at the festival.

00:22:02.459 --> 00:22:03.929
I heard you guys ask whether
it was falling in love at once...

00:22:03.930 --> 00:22:04.959
or falling in love slowly.

00:22:06.199 --> 00:22:09.130
I think it was slow for me.

00:22:09.630 --> 00:22:11.830
It was slow as if I were soaked in drizzle.

00:22:13.699 --> 00:22:15.299
Then I fell in love at once that day.

00:22:17.769 --> 00:22:20.539
"I must like this guy."

00:22:20.939 --> 00:22:23.650
"No. Maybe I've been
liking him all this while."

00:22:25.979 --> 00:22:28.150
"There would be no exit."

00:22:29.719 --> 00:22:31.590
It was like an "accident" as you say.

00:22:32.420 --> 00:22:33.518
Right.

00:22:33.519 --> 00:22:36.160
I wasn't swayed by Eun Gyeol at all.

00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:40.100
I just had a more certain
standard hidden here.

00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:43.268
I got it. Between Yi Chan and Eun Gyeol,

00:22:43.269 --> 00:22:46.298
the one who sings a serenade
at the festival is Mom's first love.

00:22:46.299 --> 00:22:48.198
And I should just watch both of them,

00:22:48.199 --> 00:22:49.310
leaving room for possibilities until then.

00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:52.810
Secretly and fairly.

00:22:55.749 --> 00:22:56.779
Let's start the lesson.

00:22:59.279 --> 00:23:01.380
What's wrong with you?

00:23:01.549 --> 00:23:03.548
I just said, "Let's start the
lesson" as soon as I came.

00:23:03.549 --> 00:23:04.749
Is that something that
makes you angry like this?

00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:14.100
Why are my parents doing this to me?

00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:16.070
What did I do wrong?

00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:24.939
(If I hadn't lent the
T-shirt to Se Gyeong...)

00:23:25.570 --> 00:23:27.310
(Se Gyeong left. Do you know
that? I hope you're not too sad.)

00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:28.880
Does she...

00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:30.478
(I ran for a long time, holding your hand.)

00:23:30.479 --> 00:23:31.749
(I was running out of breath,
dizzy, and my heart was pounding.)

00:23:32.519 --> 00:23:33.549
Does she...

00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:36.248
(This is my fax number.)

00:23:36.249 --> 00:23:37.590
(Ha Yi Chan)

00:23:38.890 --> 00:23:39.959
A heart?

00:23:44.989 --> 00:23:46.029
Do you...

00:23:46.930 --> 00:23:48.529
like Yi Chan, Mom?

00:23:51.070 --> 00:23:52.169
Hold on.

00:23:52.170 --> 00:23:54.469
Let me ask you just one question.

00:24:00.810 --> 00:24:02.979
Mom. Let me ask you just one question.

00:24:03.150 --> 00:24:04.310
Just once.

00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:10.019
Mom had a crush on Dad.

00:24:13.090 --> 00:24:15.619
If I had known it, I would've
planned another strategy.

00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:17.959
I provoked Dad for no reason.

00:24:18.999 --> 00:24:20.160
I'm screwed.

00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:27.969
(Restaurant Waryong)

00:24:28.939 --> 00:24:31.870
(Restaurant Waryong)

00:24:58.199 --> 00:25:00.400
You came? Don't get
intimidated and take a seat.

00:25:00.969 --> 00:25:02.709
I'm not going to kill you yet.

00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:12.008
Why did you open it?

00:25:12.009 --> 00:25:14.620
You said you would put it
there just to intimidate him.

00:25:15.449 --> 00:25:18.219
Darn it. It's open.

00:25:20.289 --> 00:25:21.390
Are you in choir?

00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:23.459
Why are you standing like
that? You're so distracting.

00:25:28.430 --> 00:25:29.998
- Sir.
- What?

00:25:29.999 --> 00:25:31.029
A double serving of jjajangmyeon, please.

00:25:31.330 --> 00:25:33.870
A double serving of
jjajangmyeon only? I'm getting mad.

00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:36.509
Why am I so unlucky?

00:26:15.539 --> 00:26:17.479
I thought long and hard all night.

00:26:18.410 --> 00:26:21.150
All the weird things you've done so far.

00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:24.090
When you told me that you liked Se Gyeong,

00:26:24.549 --> 00:26:25.989
everything clicked.

00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:29.630
I do owe you an apology.

00:26:30.330 --> 00:26:31.360
So...

00:26:31.489 --> 00:26:33.359
today, I shall kindly put
myself in your feet and...

00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:35.599
You mean, you'll put yourself
in my shoes? Gosh, seriously.

00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:36.698
Shut it...

00:26:36.699 --> 00:26:37.968
before I stitch your lips together!

00:26:37.969 --> 00:26:40.038
- Don't.
- Sit back down.

00:26:40.039 --> 00:26:41.199
Sit down.

00:26:43.910 --> 00:26:47.110
Fine. I shall put myself in your
shoes and tear you limb from limb...

00:26:50.310 --> 00:26:51.380
Anyway,

00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:53.948
I have a proposal you can't refuse.

00:26:53.949 --> 00:26:55.850
A proposal? What is it?

00:26:55.949 --> 00:26:59.519
I won't tell you not to see Se Gyeong,

00:27:00.289 --> 00:27:03.130
so I don't want to hear such
nonsense from you either.

00:27:03.729 --> 00:27:05.060
We'll make a truce for the time being.

00:27:05.390 --> 00:27:07.600
That way, we can focus solely
on the band before the festival.

00:27:08.459 --> 00:27:09.468
Deal?

00:27:09.469 --> 00:27:11.870
This is my chance. How am I
going to seize this opportunity?

00:27:11.999 --> 00:27:14.140
Why? You don't like
my idea? You can't do it?

00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:15.639
Forget it, then.

00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:17.269
How about we don't see her at all?

00:27:18.110 --> 00:27:19.639
Let's keep it fair between us.

00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:21.580
So both of us shouldn't see
her until the school festival.

00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:22.850
Instead,

00:27:23.449 --> 00:27:25.410
our performance at the
festival will decide the winner.

00:27:27.019 --> 00:27:28.019
What do you say?

00:27:33.860 --> 00:27:36.758
I guess you don't know
how much I've improved...

00:27:36.759 --> 00:27:37.959
since you were gone.

00:27:38.229 --> 00:27:39.600
Am I the only one hearing
this for the first time?

00:27:39.759 --> 00:27:40.799
Well...

00:27:41.430 --> 00:27:44.370
The ball is now in Se
Gyeong's court anyway.

00:27:44.570 --> 00:27:45.938
And she said she'd make her decision...

00:27:45.939 --> 00:27:47.939
once she watched us
perform at the festival,

00:27:48.699 --> 00:27:50.139
so Yi Chan has nothing to lose.

00:27:50.140 --> 00:27:51.208
You heard that?

00:27:51.209 --> 00:27:52.339
I mean,

00:27:52.340 --> 00:27:54.938
not being able to see her for
the time being will make me sad,

00:27:54.939 --> 00:27:57.579
but this could be fatal to
you. Will you be all right?

00:27:57.580 --> 00:28:01.049
Gosh. How should your brain be
wired to come up with such an answer?

00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:03.518
So? Do we have a deal?

00:28:03.519 --> 00:28:06.160
Yes, deal!

00:28:09.289 --> 00:28:10.630
He bit the bait.

00:28:11.090 --> 00:28:14.160
(20 Years of Excellence,
Traditional Chinese Cuisine)

00:28:16.130 --> 00:28:18.229
As you know, we don't have
much time left until the festival.

00:28:19.570 --> 00:28:21.899
But they say, after a rainy
day, the soil... Anyway,

00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:23.039
we can pull this off.

00:28:23.469 --> 00:28:24.939
- Let's go.
- With that said,

00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:26.209
how about a cheer?

00:28:29.110 --> 00:28:30.209
How come I only see two hands?

00:28:32.449 --> 00:28:34.350
Darn it, seriously. Hey!

00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:42.060
What?

00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:47.100
So you now work for the
Jinsung Family as a live-in tutor?

00:28:48.830 --> 00:28:49.830
Why are you surprised?

00:28:50.430 --> 00:28:51.799
Don't you know how fast rumors can travel?

00:28:52.299 --> 00:28:53.699
I heard some things, so I know that much.

00:28:53.900 --> 00:28:56.110
Well, what happened was...

00:28:56.209 --> 00:28:59.069
I met the chairman of Jinsung
by chance, and he offered help.

00:28:59.070 --> 00:29:00.110
You don't need to explain.

00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:01.879
Of course, it's much better for you...

00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:03.850
to teach an obedient
student and get paid more.

00:29:04.279 --> 00:29:06.049
Anyway, bye. I'm off.

00:29:06.279 --> 00:29:07.749
How's your grandma's health? Is she well?

00:29:12.890 --> 00:29:16.330
My gosh, Mr. Tutor.
It's so good to see you.

00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:18.759
My goodness. I missed you.

00:29:18.860 --> 00:29:20.798
Welcome, Mr. Tutor.

00:29:20.799 --> 00:29:22.430
Have you been well?

00:29:22.499 --> 00:29:24.130
Yes, thanks to you.

00:29:24.699 --> 00:29:26.968
You rascal. You should've
given me a heads-up...

00:29:26.969 --> 00:29:28.739
that you invited him over.

00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:31.140
I'm not happy with how the food turned out.

00:29:31.269 --> 00:29:33.478
Grandma, he lived here
with us up until recently.

00:29:33.479 --> 00:29:34.739
You don't need to
flaunt your cooking skills.

00:29:35.239 --> 00:29:39.209
It's not like you gave me enough
time to flaunt my skills. Goodness.

00:29:40.650 --> 00:29:42.849
- Come on in. Let's go inside.
- Okay.

00:29:42.850 --> 00:29:45.488
What? My gosh. Take me too!

00:29:45.489 --> 00:29:47.590
- Come inside, you little rascal.
- What?

00:29:53.759 --> 00:29:54.799
Here.

00:29:55.799 --> 00:29:58.400
My gosh. I'm sorry there
aren't many side dishes.

00:29:59.299 --> 00:30:00.900
That family must treat you very well.

00:30:01.170 --> 00:30:03.309
I heard they were very wealthy.

00:30:03.310 --> 00:30:05.910
No. I love your food the best, Ms. Go.

00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:10.080
My goodness. I know
you're just trying to flatter me,

00:30:10.209 --> 00:30:11.680
but thank you very much.

00:30:12.610 --> 00:30:13.948
Please dig in.

00:30:13.949 --> 00:30:16.488
Hey, go and get some scorched rice tea.

00:30:16.489 --> 00:30:18.489
Why do we need scorched rice
tea when we haven't even eaten yet?

00:30:19.289 --> 00:30:21.660
Don't ask questions.
Just go and get the tea.

00:30:24.259 --> 00:30:25.529
Please dig in.

00:30:25.989 --> 00:30:27.229
You brat.

00:30:27.630 --> 00:30:29.729
Grandma, don't say absurd things to him.

00:30:32.070 --> 00:30:33.870
I want the braised short
ribs. Save some for me.

00:30:37.239 --> 00:30:39.539
You know, while you were staying with us,

00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:42.880
did I make you uncomfortable
or hurt your feelings?

00:30:44.150 --> 00:30:47.149
No, Ms. Go. Why are you
asking me this? Not at all.

00:30:47.150 --> 00:30:49.650
You took such great care of
me when I was staying here.

00:30:51.650 --> 00:30:53.719
If that's the case,

00:30:53.890 --> 00:30:55.620
would you please consider...

00:30:56.060 --> 00:30:58.560
tutoring Yi Chan again?

00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:03.199
My goodness. Please sit comfortably.

00:31:05.100 --> 00:31:06.670
You probably don't know this,

00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:09.509
but ever since he met you,

00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:11.969
he's turned over a new leaf.

00:31:12.739 --> 00:31:14.909
In the past, he ignored
me when I was practically...

00:31:14.910 --> 00:31:18.549
begging him to quit his
part-time job, but he's finally quit.

00:31:19.049 --> 00:31:21.779
At night, he goes to the
storage room in secret...

00:31:21.979 --> 00:31:24.719
to solve math problems
and memorize English words.

00:31:25.949 --> 00:31:28.219
He wants to impress you.

00:31:30.390 --> 00:31:32.958
But ever since you moved out,

00:31:32.959 --> 00:31:35.459
he's been looking a little lost.

00:31:36.469 --> 00:31:37.900
A few days ago, he said...

00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:41.499
he was going to Ma Joo's place
to study for his exam or something.

00:31:41.539 --> 00:31:43.239
He didn't even come home that day.

00:31:43.509 --> 00:31:45.840
Goodness. He clearly didn't study that day.

00:31:46.709 --> 00:31:48.508
He came home...

00:31:48.509 --> 00:31:50.779
with bruises all over his face.

00:31:50.850 --> 00:31:53.519
Even so, how could you abandon
Yi Chan because of me? You jerk.

00:31:53.779 --> 00:31:55.448
Yi Chan was giving out flyers to find you.

00:31:55.449 --> 00:31:56.718
That's how he got beaten
up, got hit in the head,

00:31:56.719 --> 00:31:57.719
and was hospitalized too.

00:31:57.720 --> 00:32:00.519
I couldn't even ask him
if he'd gotten into a fight.

00:32:01.060 --> 00:32:03.430
I'm worried he'd become a
rebel and end up like his dad.

00:32:04.890 --> 00:32:06.430
Yi Chan's father? What about him?

00:32:10.570 --> 00:32:11.630
His father...

00:32:12.430 --> 00:32:14.498
was addicted to gambling.

00:32:14.499 --> 00:32:17.140
He always came to me for money...

00:32:18.310 --> 00:32:20.039
and hit me.

00:32:25.850 --> 00:32:27.120
So please...

00:32:27.949 --> 00:32:31.949
kindly consider tutoring Yi Chan again.

00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:37.228
I can't pay you as
much as that family does,

00:32:37.229 --> 00:32:39.600
but I'll pay you very well too. Please?

00:32:42.799 --> 00:32:46.370
Ms. Go, I'm not staying with
them because they pay me well.

00:32:47.799 --> 00:32:49.709
Then why?

00:32:50.110 --> 00:32:52.310
There's something I must
do while staying with them.

00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:54.939
It's for Yi Chan's sake.

00:32:55.610 --> 00:32:59.380
I promise you that I'll come back
as soon as I finish what I have to do.

00:33:07.620 --> 00:33:09.759
(Snail Guesthouse)

00:33:10.090 --> 00:33:11.759
Go back inside. I can go alone.

00:33:12.060 --> 00:33:14.430
Come on. Let's go. I don't
want to get yelled at by Grandma.

00:33:15.699 --> 00:33:17.969
Oh, someone fixed this.

00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:22.910
Wait up.

00:33:24.870 --> 00:33:27.340
Hey, don't tell me you beat someone up.

00:33:28.739 --> 00:33:31.110
I didn't want to waste my
energy on those jerks, so I didn't.

00:33:32.410 --> 00:33:34.719
Se Gyeong said you got
into the fight because of me.

00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:36.320
Is that true?

00:33:36.321 --> 00:33:38.890
No, it wasn't because of
you. Let's just blame my luck.

00:33:39.959 --> 00:33:41.459
Then what about being hospitalized?

00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:45.130
Were you hiding at Ma Joo's
place not to worry Ms. Go?

00:33:45.860 --> 00:33:48.330
I heard the hospital had good
food, so I went there for a few days.

00:33:48.459 --> 00:33:49.900
What? So you were actually hospitalized?

00:33:50.299 --> 00:33:52.968
Were you badly hurt? My gosh.

00:33:52.969 --> 00:33:54.869
Hey, don't overreact.

00:33:54.870 --> 00:33:56.238
As you can see, I'm totally fine.

00:33:56.239 --> 00:33:58.738
What about your ears? You didn't
hurt your ears? Can you hear well?

00:33:58.739 --> 00:34:01.039
Yes, I can hear very well. You're so loud!

00:34:01.810 --> 00:34:04.580
Darn you. Why did you
disappear if you were this worried?

00:34:05.610 --> 00:34:08.120
Forget it. That reminds me.

00:34:08.219 --> 00:34:10.150
Give my thanks to Yoon
Chung Ah when you get home.

00:34:11.150 --> 00:34:12.319
You know Yoon Chung Ah?

00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:15.060
Not well. I think she and
Se Gyeong are friends.

00:34:15.459 --> 00:34:16.930
Anyway, give her my thanks.

00:34:17.289 --> 00:34:18.759
She saved my life.

00:34:18.860 --> 00:34:21.360
Chung Ah saved your life? How?

00:34:21.830 --> 00:34:24.600
Ask her directly. I don't
remember what happened.

00:34:25.430 --> 00:34:27.298
I went to see her to thank her
and ask her what happened,

00:34:27.299 --> 00:34:28.500
but they kicked me out.

00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:32.739
Then how do you know that
Chung Ah saved your life?

00:34:33.140 --> 00:34:34.609
Oh, Se Gyeong told me.

00:34:36.509 --> 00:34:38.878
It's Ma Joo. Bye, then.

00:34:38.879 --> 00:34:41.648
Why don't you come with me
now and thank Chung Ah in person?

00:34:41.649 --> 00:34:43.290
Another time. He said to hurry.

00:34:43.620 --> 00:34:45.149
We're going to tweak the set list together.

00:34:45.319 --> 00:34:46.359
Bye.

00:34:47.419 --> 00:34:49.089
If you're late for
practice, I will kill you.

00:34:50.629 --> 00:34:52.589
If you see Se Gyeong behind
my back, you're so dead.

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:55.830
Do that, and our deal's off. We
won't be friends anymore. Got it?

00:34:58.870 --> 00:35:00.569
Dad got hurt because of me.

00:35:05.140 --> 00:35:06.210
Consequently,

00:35:06.910 --> 00:35:09.279
Mom saved Dad's life.

00:35:10.210 --> 00:35:12.710
Dad, how did you and Mom meet?

00:35:17.719 --> 00:35:21.190
I met her in a sign language
class when I was 20.

00:35:22.290 --> 00:35:23.989
I went there to learn sign language...

00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:25.989
and fell in love with your
mom the moment I saw her.

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:29.399
At age 18, Dad didn't know Mom.

00:35:30.370 --> 00:35:32.000
But now, he knows her.

00:35:38.239 --> 00:35:40.980
Mom, who had a crush on Dad at age 18,

00:35:41.810 --> 00:35:43.548
now has a connecting link.

00:35:43.549 --> 00:35:45.350
(Bestin Rabbit Thirty Seven Ice Cream)

00:35:45.779 --> 00:35:46.850
It's me.

00:35:48.779 --> 00:35:52.049
I'm the link that can connect
Mom and Dad at age 18.

00:35:52.649 --> 00:35:53.690
And...

00:35:53.790 --> 00:35:55.560
How about we don't see her at all?

00:35:56.060 --> 00:35:57.659
Let's keep it fair between us.

00:35:57.660 --> 00:35:59.629
So both of us shouldn't see
her until the school festival.

00:36:00.699 --> 00:36:01.759
Deal!

00:36:04.930 --> 00:36:06.370
A chance that presented
itself at an opportune time.

00:36:10.870 --> 00:36:12.809
The roadblock called
Choi Se Gyeong is gone.

00:36:12.810 --> 00:36:14.339
I must not miss this chance.

00:36:14.910 --> 00:36:17.250
I must make Mom and Dad fall
for each other before the festival...

00:36:17.509 --> 00:36:19.879
and find out when Dad's
accident took place...

00:36:20.250 --> 00:36:22.419
so that I can prevent it, no matter what.

00:37:08.942 --> 00:37:11.683
I'm the Queen of Cello at Seowon Arts High,

00:37:12.183 --> 00:37:13.212
Choi Se Gyeong.

00:37:16.212 --> 00:37:18.352
- Choi Se Gyeong is here!
- Hey, let's go!

00:37:18.353 --> 00:37:20.393
- Oh, my.
- Hey, come on.

00:37:20.552 --> 00:37:22.322
- Let's go see her.
- My gosh.

00:37:27.226 --> 00:37:29.435
- She's really pretty.
- She's so hot!

00:37:29.436 --> 00:37:30.965
- Hey.
- Hi, Se Gyeong!

00:37:35.236 --> 00:37:36.305
Wait just one moment.

00:37:39.845 --> 00:37:41.305
Move over. I must see her!

00:37:43.115 --> 00:37:44.715
Hey, step aside.

00:37:52.285 --> 00:37:53.356
Se Gyeong.

00:37:54.285 --> 00:37:55.285
Choi Se Gyeong!

00:37:57.114 --> 00:37:58.114
Hey.

00:37:59.114 --> 00:38:00.444
You really hurt my feelings.

00:38:00.913 --> 00:38:03.784
I can't believe you never called
me when you returned to Korea.

00:38:04.183 --> 00:38:05.983
I'm sorry, but who are you?

00:38:07.083 --> 00:38:08.123
Who am I?

00:38:08.724 --> 00:38:10.523
You really don't know who I am?

00:38:10.994 --> 00:38:13.663
Shoot. At this rate, they might
find out on my first day that...

00:38:14.264 --> 00:38:15.463
Hey, it's me.

00:38:15.864 --> 00:38:17.634
Yoon Sang A from Seowon Arts High School.

00:38:18.163 --> 00:38:20.233
My family owned Jinsung
Musical Instruments, remember?

00:38:22.034 --> 00:38:23.733
I did hear you moved back to Korea.

00:38:24.273 --> 00:38:25.733
So it was true, after all.

00:38:28.143 --> 00:38:30.713
My gosh. Is she your daughter?

00:38:31.074 --> 00:38:32.244
Hi.

00:38:33.614 --> 00:38:36.583
Oh, my. She looks just
like you back in high school.

00:38:37.784 --> 00:38:40.623
Darn it. She's that
chatty, slow-witted lady?

00:38:41.083 --> 00:38:43.553
My gosh. My eyes are welling up with tears.

00:38:43.554 --> 00:38:46.393
Hey, I was just kidding.

00:38:46.494 --> 00:38:48.223
You're Yoon Sang A, the
daughter of the Jinsung family.

00:38:48.224 --> 00:38:49.933
Of course, I know you.

00:38:50.663 --> 00:38:52.433
How have you been, Sang A?

00:38:52.694 --> 00:38:54.463
Whatever, you meanie.

00:38:54.764 --> 00:38:56.574
I bet you didn't miss me at all.

00:38:57.404 --> 00:38:59.304
I sent you letters, but you
never once wrote me back.

00:38:59.404 --> 00:39:01.244
You didn't even bother to
page me when you came back.

00:39:01.704 --> 00:39:03.043
You heartless girl.

00:39:03.614 --> 00:39:05.212
Are we really best friends?

00:39:05.213 --> 00:39:06.913
Wait, hold on.

00:39:07.643 --> 00:39:10.412
You're my best friend? Not Yoon Chung Ah?

00:39:10.413 --> 00:39:11.454
Hey!

00:39:24.194 --> 00:39:25.963
I have to go to the
Teachers' Office quickly.

00:39:26.433 --> 00:39:28.634
I'll probably be
reprimanded for that incident.

00:39:29.034 --> 00:39:32.174
It'll be nothing serious,
so don't worry too much.

00:39:40.313 --> 00:39:42.744
Don't report every single
thing to me. It's annoying.

00:39:53.764 --> 00:39:55.123
(I know why you're angry. I'll help you.)

00:40:06.074 --> 00:40:07.904
I know why you're angry.

00:40:08.204 --> 00:40:09.444
I'll help you.

00:40:09.844 --> 00:40:11.413
So please forgive me.

00:40:11.744 --> 00:40:13.213
I'm always on your side.

00:40:19.413 --> 00:40:21.853
Hey, what do you need
to check with Chung Ah?

00:40:22.353 --> 00:40:24.253
I swear, I am your best friend.

00:40:24.324 --> 00:40:27.063
What's going on? Why is Se
Gyeong at school at this hour?

00:40:27.324 --> 00:40:29.663
Does Chung Ah know that
you've now returned to school?

00:40:29.694 --> 00:40:32.163
What? She'll attend school again?

00:40:34.404 --> 00:40:35.462
What should I do?

00:40:35.463 --> 00:40:36.904
She saw me. Should I say hi?

00:40:36.974 --> 00:40:38.904
If you see Se Gyeong behind
my back, you're so dead.

00:40:39.034 --> 00:40:41.804
Do that, and our deal's off. We
won't be friends anymore. Got it?

00:40:55.083 --> 00:40:57.224
I'm sorry, Ms. Choi. Please forgive me.

00:40:58.123 --> 00:40:59.252
That Shiba Sky.

00:40:59.253 --> 00:41:00.393
Hey, stop right there!

00:41:01.663 --> 00:41:03.364
Sorry, move.

00:41:05.764 --> 00:41:07.003
Hey, Shiba Sky!

00:41:11.773 --> 00:41:12.773
Guys, move!

00:41:17.974 --> 00:41:18.974
Hey, Ha Yi Chan!

00:41:22.083 --> 00:41:23.413
You won't fall down like that.

00:41:23.654 --> 00:41:24.683
Hey, we've got a problem.

00:41:25.054 --> 00:41:28.023
I just checked a voicemail
message from Yong Jun Ki.

00:41:28.224 --> 00:41:30.253
Se Gyeong will be going
to school starting today.

00:41:30.424 --> 00:41:31.724
- What about it?
- What?

00:41:32.054 --> 00:41:33.264
- What?
- That's right.

00:41:33.824 --> 00:41:35.364
Then she'll be seeing
that jerk, Ha Eun Gyeol,

00:41:35.764 --> 00:41:37.293
at school every day.

00:41:37.463 --> 00:41:39.093
Exactly.

00:41:39.094 --> 00:41:41.063
From what I heard, they're
already chasing each other.

00:41:42.063 --> 00:41:45.102
Ha Eun Gyeol, that jerk. I bet he
knew everything from the get-go.

00:41:45.103 --> 00:41:46.204
Hey, where are you going?

00:41:47.574 --> 00:41:48.773
The only thing I can do...

00:41:49.103 --> 00:41:50.413
is outshine him.

00:41:51.574 --> 00:41:52.574
On that note,

00:41:53.284 --> 00:41:54.683
I must practice.

00:41:56.913 --> 00:41:57.913
Let's go!

00:42:01.183 --> 00:42:02.183
What is this?

00:42:05.554 --> 00:42:06.563
What's going on here?

00:42:08.924 --> 00:42:10.893
This is the band room.
What are you doing here?

00:42:11.094 --> 00:42:13.634
What? Didn't the teacher tell you?

00:42:14.364 --> 00:42:16.134
This room is ours, as of today.

00:42:21.704 --> 00:42:22.773
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:42:23.614 --> 00:42:24.913
Sir, wait!

00:42:25.674 --> 00:42:26.813
Wait.

00:42:27.643 --> 00:42:30.812
Sir, you didn't say anything
about it the other day.

00:42:30.813 --> 00:42:31.912
I told you.

00:42:31.913 --> 00:42:34.053
The decision came from the
Guidance Committee. I have no choice.

00:42:34.054 --> 00:42:35.983
Even so, you can't take
the band room away from us!

00:42:36.324 --> 00:42:38.223
It's like telling us to disband!

00:42:38.224 --> 00:42:39.924
Bingo. I'd appreciate that.

00:42:40.623 --> 00:42:42.724
Stop. Don't go!

00:42:43.433 --> 00:42:44.693
We want the room back!

00:42:44.694 --> 00:42:45.863
You little...

00:42:45.864 --> 00:42:46.932
Let go.

00:42:46.933 --> 00:42:49.533
- My pants will get ripped!
- Wait, please.

00:42:49.534 --> 00:42:50.932
The festival is right around the corner.

00:42:50.933 --> 00:42:52.704
This really isn't fair!

00:42:52.904 --> 00:42:54.643
I'd rather have you walk all over me!

00:42:55.273 --> 00:42:56.843
Say one more word,

00:42:56.844 --> 00:42:59.174
and you guys can't perform at the festival.

00:42:59.674 --> 00:43:01.482
- No!
- Hey.

00:43:01.483 --> 00:43:03.412
- Please!
- Hey, let go.

00:43:03.413 --> 00:43:04.654
- Hey!
- Please!

00:43:08.483 --> 00:43:10.893
(19th, Jin Bo Ra)

00:43:12.054 --> 00:43:14.623
I guess we're not meant
to do this band thing.

00:43:22.904 --> 00:43:25.273
Who's this jerk that's humming?

00:43:28.074 --> 00:43:29.373
Oh, boy.

00:43:30.074 --> 00:43:31.143
What can I do?

00:43:31.773 --> 00:43:33.713
My private hotel has closed its doors.

00:43:33.884 --> 00:43:36.182
So sadly, I shall look for
someplace else to stay.

00:43:36.183 --> 00:43:37.983
Is that even a joke?

00:43:38.413 --> 00:43:40.453
I can't stop grimacing as
I'm listening to your nonsense.

00:43:40.454 --> 00:43:42.454
You guys can follow me if you'd like.

00:43:43.853 --> 00:43:46.793
You always find hidden
treasures where you fall.

00:43:50.793 --> 00:43:51.963
Let's go dig up some treasures.

00:43:54.733 --> 00:43:57.773
Submit letters of apology and
volunteer at school for a week.

00:43:57.974 --> 00:44:00.244
We're doing this instead of placing
you on probation, so be grateful.

00:44:12.313 --> 00:44:14.083
(Keep the door closed.
Whose tail is this long?)

00:44:15.483 --> 00:44:16.753
Hey, stop right there.

00:44:18.393 --> 00:44:19.493
- Here, bye!
- Hey!

00:44:19.494 --> 00:44:20.724
What are you two doing?

00:44:21.424 --> 00:44:22.924
(Letter of Apology, Ha Eun Gyeol)

00:44:24.063 --> 00:44:26.194
That little... Hey!

00:44:27.034 --> 00:44:28.034
Hey, Ha Eun Gyeol!

00:44:30.433 --> 00:44:32.772
Were they slave
hunters in their past lives?

00:44:32.773 --> 00:44:34.142
They chase each other all day long...

00:44:34.143 --> 00:44:35.704
- Hey!
- whenever their eyes meet.

00:44:37.413 --> 00:44:38.444
My gosh.

00:44:39.074 --> 00:44:41.313
Gosh, how romantic.

00:44:41.784 --> 00:44:43.384
When I catch you, I'll really...

00:44:44.454 --> 00:44:45.483
Hey!

00:44:49.353 --> 00:44:50.423
Hey, let me borrow this.

00:44:50.424 --> 00:44:52.122
What? Hey, that's not fair!

00:44:52.123 --> 00:44:53.364
Are you sure this is romantic?

00:44:53.694 --> 00:44:55.063
- She'd kill him if he got caught.
- Hey!

00:44:58.163 --> 00:45:00.034
- Hey!
- What? What is happening?

00:45:15.313 --> 00:45:17.253
Let me catch you while
I'm still talking to you nicely.

00:45:18.353 --> 00:45:20.324
If you run away again, I will kill you!

00:45:20.853 --> 00:45:21.924
Hey!

00:45:29.724 --> 00:45:31.832
Because of your confession,
everyone thinks we're dating.

00:45:31.833 --> 00:45:33.903
And now, you're humiliating
me in front of the whole school?

00:45:33.904 --> 00:45:34.904
What am I, a virus?

00:45:34.905 --> 00:45:36.304
Why are you avoiding
me? Why did you run away?

00:45:36.873 --> 00:45:38.733
Yi Chan and I made a deal...

00:45:39.074 --> 00:45:42.003
that we wouldn't see you
for the time being to be fair.

00:45:42.304 --> 00:45:44.014
So? You're in self-quarantine?

00:45:44.114 --> 00:45:45.843
- Until when?
- The day of the festival.

00:45:45.844 --> 00:45:48.083
- When can you end your quarantine?
- Once the festival is over.

00:45:48.413 --> 00:45:51.054
You really are putting everything
on the line for the festival.

00:45:52.083 --> 00:45:53.783
In any case, just know that.

00:45:53.784 --> 00:45:55.582
Your cooperation will be appreciated.

00:45:55.583 --> 00:45:57.852
Cooperation, my foot! Am I your toy?

00:45:57.853 --> 00:45:59.194
Who says you two can toy with me like this?

00:45:59.324 --> 00:46:01.123
- Don't get me wrong.
- Forget it.

00:46:01.924 --> 00:46:04.563
Anyway, it means that
the ball is in my court now.

00:46:04.694 --> 00:46:06.962
And I can do whatever I want...

00:46:06.963 --> 00:46:08.003
with that ball, right?

00:46:08.963 --> 00:46:10.503
What will you do with it?

00:46:10.574 --> 00:46:12.003
None of your business.

00:46:12.103 --> 00:46:13.873
Go. You're free to go.

00:46:18.574 --> 00:46:19.574
I'm getting a bad feeling.

00:46:20.444 --> 00:46:21.483
I have a bad feeling about this.

00:46:31.353 --> 00:46:32.594
Hey. It's me, Ma Joo.

00:46:32.753 --> 00:46:34.924
Don't tell anyone what
I'm about to tell you.

00:46:35.523 --> 00:46:36.832
We don't have access to
the band room anymore.

00:46:36.833 --> 00:46:38.792
We found a new spot where we can practice.

00:46:38.793 --> 00:46:39.932
Except for the band members,

00:46:39.933 --> 00:46:42.102
no one else can know where it is.

00:46:42.103 --> 00:46:43.432
We must keep this a secret,

00:46:43.433 --> 00:46:45.674
so remember that no
outsiders are allowed to visit.

00:46:51.744 --> 00:46:52.844
(Seowon Arts High School)

00:47:03.793 --> 00:47:05.423
I said I'd help you.

00:47:05.424 --> 00:47:06.864
I want to take you somewhere.

00:47:10.393 --> 00:47:11.733
(I said I'd help you. I want
to take you somewhere.)

00:47:25.474 --> 00:47:26.813
I know I'm cheating,

00:47:27.384 --> 00:47:29.583
but I have no choice but to do this,
so Mom and Dad end up together.

00:47:31.983 --> 00:47:33.522
I'm telling you, for real.

00:47:33.523 --> 00:47:34.783
I thought you were Lee Moon Sae.

00:47:34.784 --> 00:47:36.424
My goodness. Don't exaggerate.

00:47:37.924 --> 00:47:40.863
I tried portraying the red in
the burning sunset in gradation.

00:47:40.864 --> 00:47:43.094
What do you say? Could you see it?

00:47:43.594 --> 00:47:44.694
Yes, totally.

00:47:44.933 --> 00:47:46.932
When the sunset unfolded
right before my eyes,

00:47:46.933 --> 00:47:48.962
I felt as though I was
seeing a sea of blood.

00:47:48.963 --> 00:47:51.034
- My gosh. It really was amazing.
- I knew it.

00:47:51.804 --> 00:47:53.203
I'm sorry, Se Gyeong.

00:47:53.204 --> 00:47:55.474
I ended up wasting my
talent because of some jerk,

00:47:55.773 --> 00:47:58.213
but I promise I'll sing a
serenade for you at the festival.

00:47:58.944 --> 00:47:59.974
A serenade?

00:48:00.213 --> 00:48:02.284
A serenade? No.

00:48:04.054 --> 00:48:05.554
What is going on here?

00:48:05.853 --> 00:48:07.454
Hey, you're here.

00:48:07.523 --> 00:48:09.153
- Hey.
- I thought this place was a secret,

00:48:09.154 --> 00:48:10.694
and no outsiders were allowed to enter.

00:48:11.623 --> 00:48:13.054
That's rich coming from you.

00:48:13.824 --> 00:48:16.163
- Come out for a moment.
- Oh, my. I'm so very scared.

00:48:16.364 --> 00:48:18.792
Hey, think about what you did.

00:48:18.793 --> 00:48:20.163
Why are you getting so worked up?

00:48:20.503 --> 00:48:22.432
- Come here.
- Let go!

00:48:22.433 --> 00:48:24.634
I can walk with my own legs...

00:48:27.444 --> 00:48:29.904
Hey, go!

00:48:31.273 --> 00:48:32.674
They're at it again.

00:48:33.413 --> 00:48:35.013
Ever since I met them,

00:48:35.014 --> 00:48:37.454
I've been feeling like I'm on a
suspension bridge every day.

00:48:40.083 --> 00:48:41.083
Hi.

00:48:42.183 --> 00:48:43.253
Hey.

00:48:47.324 --> 00:48:48.393
She knows sign language?

00:48:54.634 --> 00:48:56.433
Hey, are you really going to do this?

00:48:56.534 --> 00:48:59.332
You promised me you wouldn't
see her before the festival.

00:48:59.333 --> 00:49:00.543
You're a coward.

00:49:00.674 --> 00:49:03.002
You did that because you knew Se
Gyeong was coming back to school.

00:49:03.003 --> 00:49:05.272
Hey, how many times have
I told you that I had no idea?

00:49:05.273 --> 00:49:08.283
Do you know what I went
through just to keep my promise?

00:49:08.284 --> 00:49:09.513
If that makes you this angry,

00:49:09.514 --> 00:49:11.513
just let yourself be the
scumbag that you are...

00:49:11.514 --> 00:49:13.352
instead of lying to my face all the time.

00:49:13.353 --> 00:49:15.454
My gosh. This really is nuts.

00:49:16.353 --> 00:49:18.393
Fine, forget the promise.

00:49:19.023 --> 00:49:20.494
But can you break the
rules as our front man?

00:49:20.824 --> 00:49:23.493
You guys said it was a secret, and
no outsiders were allowed to enter.

00:49:23.494 --> 00:49:25.493
Look who's talking. You
brought an outsider along too!

00:49:25.494 --> 00:49:26.962
I brought her along for a reason!

00:49:26.963 --> 00:49:29.602
She'll be our HMS designer.

00:49:29.603 --> 00:49:31.272
Whatever. What is "HMS?"

00:49:31.273 --> 00:49:32.332
Hair, makeup, style!

00:49:32.333 --> 00:49:35.272
Goodness. Do you think I brought
Se Gyeong along for no reason?

00:49:35.273 --> 00:49:37.212
I politely recruited her.

00:49:37.213 --> 00:49:38.912
As our official photographer,
who will make...

00:49:38.913 --> 00:49:41.743
all our promotional posters,
pamphlets, and even music videos.

00:49:41.744 --> 00:49:42.744
PPM!

00:49:43.213 --> 00:49:44.783
Only because you like her.

00:49:44.784 --> 00:49:46.352
We don't even know if
she can do those things.

00:49:46.353 --> 00:49:48.553
You brought Chung Ah because
you have a personal agenda.

00:49:48.554 --> 00:49:50.522
You want to win points
with the girl you're tutoring!

00:49:50.523 --> 00:49:52.323
You haven't seen Chung
Ah's drawings, have you?

00:49:52.324 --> 00:49:55.823
Chung Ah can design
stages, costumes, and posters.

00:49:55.824 --> 00:49:58.432
She's a multitalented
artist who can do everything!

00:49:58.433 --> 00:50:01.204
You haven't seen the photos Se
Gyeong took at the amusement park.

00:50:01.333 --> 00:50:03.772
My Se Gyeong is pretty and uber-talented.

00:50:03.773 --> 00:50:05.704
She's a woman of many
talents. What's your problem?

00:50:06.174 --> 00:50:07.244
You little...

00:50:10.313 --> 00:50:11.373
Have you eaten yet?

00:50:12.074 --> 00:50:14.042
Se Gyeong, you know sign language?

00:50:14.043 --> 00:50:15.744
Oh, just a little.

00:50:17.114 --> 00:50:18.513
I really am not that good.

00:50:18.514 --> 00:50:19.554
When did you learn it?

00:50:19.884 --> 00:50:22.323
My deaf friend taught me
briefly a few years back,

00:50:22.324 --> 00:50:23.993
but I really am not good.

00:50:23.994 --> 00:50:26.053
Don't say that. You are good.

00:50:26.054 --> 00:50:28.193
What did you mean
earlier? When you did this.

00:50:28.194 --> 00:50:29.924
Earlier? Oh, that.

00:50:30.194 --> 00:50:32.994
"Don't go. Stay with me."

00:50:35.364 --> 00:50:37.473
- Oh, my.
- No, I'm embarrassed.

00:50:37.474 --> 00:50:39.602
- You're good.
- You're a pro.

00:50:39.603 --> 00:50:40.903
Your compliments are making me blush.

00:50:40.904 --> 00:50:42.803
- Why is she so nice today?
- Hey, go home.

00:50:42.804 --> 00:50:44.712
- Me?
- I can't stand you. Leave.

00:50:44.713 --> 00:50:45.772
I don't like you either.

00:50:45.773 --> 00:50:47.284
Se Gyeong, spare me a moment.

00:50:48.284 --> 00:50:49.284
That little...

00:50:50.244 --> 00:50:51.514
What do you think you're doing?

00:50:51.683 --> 00:50:53.082
You said to check if she could do the job.

00:50:53.083 --> 00:50:54.654
I heard you'd be our photographer.

00:50:55.253 --> 00:50:57.753
I recommended Chung Ah as our designer.

00:50:58.224 --> 00:51:00.623
Yi Chan and I will have
to cross-check your skills.

00:51:00.724 --> 00:51:02.892
I hope you cooperate and
take the test to prove your skills.

00:51:02.893 --> 00:51:04.932
Yes, sure thing. I shall cooperate.

00:51:04.933 --> 00:51:06.594
Let's go. Do you just need
me to take some pictures?

00:51:08.063 --> 00:51:10.102
Se Gyeong. Hey!

00:51:10.103 --> 00:51:12.134
Hey, you must think the
world revolves around you!

00:51:12.204 --> 00:51:14.273
- Darn it!
- Clearly, we can't practice today.

00:51:14.974 --> 00:51:16.003
Hey.

00:51:16.503 --> 00:51:18.574
Page me once you guys
are done with the skills test.

00:51:18.844 --> 00:51:20.014
Let's go play some video games.

00:51:21.413 --> 00:51:23.583
Gosh, do we need a
shamanic ritual or something?

00:51:25.483 --> 00:51:27.623
Hey, page us.

00:51:28.884 --> 00:51:29.954
Darn it.

00:51:42.304 --> 00:51:43.432
Wait up, will you?

00:51:43.433 --> 00:51:45.534
What will you do if I don't follow you?

00:51:46.574 --> 00:51:47.574
That's yours, right?

00:51:48.344 --> 00:51:50.912
Why? Do I have to prove
my driving skills too?

00:51:50.913 --> 00:51:53.143
No, I'll drive. Hand over the keys.

00:51:53.744 --> 00:51:54.783
Where are we going?

00:51:54.784 --> 00:51:56.813
We'll get a disposable camera
and go to an outdoor spot.

00:51:56.884 --> 00:51:59.483
I've already picked a good
location to shoot our music video.

00:51:59.884 --> 00:52:02.724
You'll take pictures,
and I'll verify your skills.

00:52:03.253 --> 00:52:04.324
Deal?

00:52:05.194 --> 00:52:06.323
I shall make...

00:52:06.324 --> 00:52:07.823
this one sacrifice for Yi Chan,

00:52:07.824 --> 00:52:09.764
who is pouring his heart
and soul into the band.

00:52:10.163 --> 00:52:11.163
Here.

00:52:27.944 --> 00:52:29.014
Hi.

00:52:33.014 --> 00:52:35.853
Oh, right. Well...

00:52:36.753 --> 00:52:38.824
The other day,

00:52:40.054 --> 00:52:41.094
you...

00:52:42.293 --> 00:52:44.833
saved me. Thank you for that.

00:52:45.663 --> 00:52:46.663
He's using sign language again?

00:52:47.233 --> 00:52:48.904
And I'm sorry.

00:52:49.733 --> 00:52:51.373
I didn't know...

00:52:52.873 --> 00:52:55.304
that you were the one who saved me.

00:52:57.344 --> 00:52:59.043
Also...

00:53:00.413 --> 00:53:02.313
Oh, I didn't practice this one.

00:53:09.483 --> 00:53:10.594
Shall we look at your drawings now?

00:53:14.594 --> 00:53:16.863
Hey, how far are we going?

00:53:16.864 --> 00:53:17.993
We're almost there!

00:53:17.994 --> 00:53:19.432
You should've just picked somewhere close.

00:53:19.433 --> 00:53:20.903
Why do we have to go so far?

00:53:20.904 --> 00:53:21.933
What do you think?

00:53:22.063 --> 00:53:24.704
I'm doing this so Mom and Dad
can spend some time together, alone.

00:53:27.373 --> 00:53:29.143
What's wrong? Why did you stop?

00:53:34.344 --> 00:53:36.713
We've run out of gas.

00:53:36.913 --> 00:53:37.913
What?

00:53:37.914 --> 00:53:40.554
Darn you. I'm so annoyed!

00:53:44.224 --> 00:53:45.224
Oh, my.

00:53:46.253 --> 00:53:47.364
My gosh.

00:53:49.264 --> 00:53:50.264
Nice.

00:53:52.463 --> 00:53:53.463
This is awesome.

00:54:10.014 --> 00:54:11.083
Oh.

00:54:15.154 --> 00:54:16.284
Darn it, seriously.

00:54:19.023 --> 00:54:20.293
Hey.

00:54:20.924 --> 00:54:22.392
Why don't we leave the scooter here...

00:54:22.393 --> 00:54:23.622
and go to the main road?

00:54:23.623 --> 00:54:24.733
We can still catch the last bus.

00:54:25.194 --> 00:54:26.533
It's not yours, so you don't care?

00:54:26.534 --> 00:54:29.233
We can't hitchhike with the scooter.

00:54:29.634 --> 00:54:32.303
I promise you that I'll pick it
up and bring it to you tomorrow.

00:54:32.304 --> 00:54:34.844
Honestly, you really are...

00:54:37.244 --> 00:54:39.143
- What?
- What?

00:54:39.643 --> 00:54:42.343
- Oh, here!
- Stop!

00:54:42.344 --> 00:54:43.982
- Sir! Help us just this once!
- Just this once!

00:54:43.983 --> 00:54:46.114
- Please, stop!
- Please!

00:55:09.244 --> 00:55:11.074
Why are you doing all this, really?

00:55:11.413 --> 00:55:12.444
What do you mean?

00:55:13.174 --> 00:55:14.744
You don't even like me.

00:55:15.244 --> 00:55:17.014
What are you talking about? I do like you.

00:55:17.183 --> 00:55:19.753
My gosh. You couldn't
have sounded more insincere.

00:55:19.884 --> 00:55:22.022
Forget it. I can't talk to you.

00:55:22.023 --> 00:55:23.582
(Bus)

00:55:23.583 --> 00:55:24.654
What about you?

00:55:25.494 --> 00:55:26.522
You said you'd do whatever
you wanted with the ball.

00:55:26.523 --> 00:55:27.523
So this was it?

00:55:28.194 --> 00:55:29.963
Throwing it to Yi Chan once,

00:55:30.023 --> 00:55:31.733
and then once to me?

00:55:31.864 --> 00:55:34.503
You guys will play it fair while
toying with me, but I can't?

00:55:34.904 --> 00:55:36.962
I want to be fair to you both too.

00:55:36.963 --> 00:55:39.732
I'll play with the ball until
the day of the festival,

00:55:39.733 --> 00:55:41.074
in a fair manner.

00:55:50.614 --> 00:55:51.753
You know...

00:55:53.554 --> 00:55:54.623
About that ball.

00:55:57.853 --> 00:55:59.654
Can you throw the ball only to me?

00:56:02.063 --> 00:56:04.163
I'm very confident
that I can catch it well.

00:56:06.793 --> 00:56:08.804
Even if I get hit by the ball
because you threw it carelessly,

00:56:10.163 --> 00:56:11.433
I'll be fine.

00:56:12.603 --> 00:56:14.674
I'm confident I won't lose
the ball even if I'm in pain.

00:56:15.704 --> 00:56:17.373
I know I won't let anyone take it from me,

00:56:18.273 --> 00:56:20.444
and I'm confident I'd get it
back even if I were to lose it.

00:56:25.483 --> 00:56:27.253
So can you throw it only to me?

00:56:30.994 --> 00:56:31.994
What's your answer?

00:56:35.463 --> 00:56:37.694
Sing for me, and I'll think about it.

00:56:38.333 --> 00:56:41.204
Here, all of a sudden? That's random.

00:56:41.333 --> 00:56:42.463
Forget it if you don't want to do it.

00:56:42.563 --> 00:56:44.404
But Yi Chan would totally sing for me.

00:56:45.034 --> 00:56:47.873
He will sing a serenade
for me at the festival.

00:56:48.103 --> 00:56:51.744
Would you know my name

00:56:54.143 --> 00:56:57.384
If I saw you in heaven

00:57:00.083 --> 00:57:03.924
Would it be the same

00:57:06.094 --> 00:57:09.364
If I saw you in heaven

00:57:12.463 --> 00:57:16.103
I must be strong

00:57:18.503 --> 00:57:21.344
And carry on

00:57:21.704 --> 00:57:27.273
Because I know I don't belong

00:57:28.183 --> 00:57:30.114
Here in heaven

00:57:57.974 --> 00:57:59.313
Suddenly, it hit me.

00:58:01.413 --> 00:58:03.514
The spring of 1995.

00:58:05.913 --> 00:58:07.884
Just like Mom and Dad,

00:58:09.853 --> 00:58:11.224
I was also 18.

00:59:08.683 --> 00:59:13.554
(Twinkling Watermelon)

00:59:14.014 --> 00:59:16.384
Can we be friends?

00:59:16.554 --> 00:59:19.054
Do you like me?

00:59:20.353 --> 00:59:22.363
Then please tell me when
my dad's accident took place.

00:59:22.364 --> 00:59:24.292
Actually, I found and sent...

00:59:24.293 --> 00:59:26.133
the perfect helper for you.

00:59:26.134 --> 00:59:28.364
"Helper?" Who's that?

00:59:28.463 --> 00:59:30.033
Is Yoon Dong Jin the "helper?"

00:59:30.034 --> 00:59:32.502
I believe the contract you signed
with the chairman is for a month.

00:59:32.503 --> 00:59:34.102
You'd better leave before that.

00:59:34.103 --> 00:59:35.243
I need to know how I can go back...

00:59:35.244 --> 00:59:37.503
to decide whether or not to go back.

00:59:37.873 --> 00:59:40.412
Hey, can you spare me a moment?

00:59:40.413 --> 00:59:43.244
Sorry. I shouldn't have let myself
fall for you. I made a mistake.
