All right.

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:14.680
Hey, beat him up.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.479
- You punk.
- Hey.

00:01:18.779 --> 00:01:19.820
Gosh. Seriously.

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.019
See? If you had just listened to
us and given us the money you had,

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.089
we would have let you go unscathed too.

00:01:28.389 --> 00:01:30.830
This is the problem with
high school kids in this country.

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.460
It is a serious problem, isn't it?

00:01:32.559 --> 00:01:33.599
What's the problem exactly?

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.229
When you're nice to them, they
just assume that you're actually nice.

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:39.740
Gosh. Creativity is the last
thing you guys will ever have.

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.050
If you can't turn over a new leaf,
at least change your repertoire.

00:01:52.449 --> 00:01:53.919
Aren't you sick of using
the same lines for years?

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.190
Hey.

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.220
How did you end up here? Goodness.

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:03.960
Leave before you get picked on again.

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.430
Thank you so much.

00:02:13.399 --> 00:02:14.869
What do you think you're
doing, Kang Hyun Yul?

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:19.809
Being a thug is difficult once
you take a closer look, isn't it?

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.148
You have to figure out their pager numbers,

00:02:22.149 --> 00:02:23.909
lie to them in order to lure them out,

00:02:24.149 --> 00:02:26.119
and extort money from them
by delivering lame threats.

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:27.718
Hey, thanks to you guys,

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:29.619
there might be a new job in our future.

00:02:29.719 --> 00:02:30.890
The job will be called...

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:35.659
Yes. How about "voice phishing?"

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:38.830
You little...

00:02:46.469 --> 00:02:47.499
Hey.

00:02:48.339 --> 00:02:50.139
What are you doing? Beat him up!

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.339
- Beat him up.
- Darn it. Come on!

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:55.309
- No! I'm sorry. Wait.
- You punk.

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:57.980
I'm sorry.

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.159
Gosh.

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:16.930
Darn it.

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:27.140
Did you beat up my frontman?

00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:28.649
Who on earth is that?

00:03:31.619 --> 00:03:33.319
The guy who was putting up this poster.

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:36.549
You gave him a head injury,
so his head got so bloody.

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:38.289
Why do you care?

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:39.760
Why wouldn't I care?

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:41.859
If he gets hurt, our band
can't perform at the festival.

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:43.089
And if I can't perform,

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:45.930
I will lose all the girls who
would have been my fans.

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:50.270
Look at you.

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:53.140
You've really become a mere entertainer.

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:58.339
Let me warn you.

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.149
Leave my guys alone.

00:04:06.749 --> 00:04:07.790
Hey.

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:11.819
Do Jin will be discharged temporarily soon.

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:15.129
You'd better watch your six at night.

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:17.260
Or you might get stabbed from behind.

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:23.700
Relay this message to Do Jin.

00:04:24.499 --> 00:04:26.240
He and I revolve in different worlds now.

00:04:27.499 --> 00:04:28.770
So we should stick to our own world...

00:04:30.209 --> 00:04:31.610
and live our lives honestly.

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:41.850
Hey, who on earth is that jerk?

00:04:42.019 --> 00:04:43.290
Jung Do Jin's right-hand man.

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:45.559
He was number two in Jindo Dog Gang.

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:47.290
When a certain incident took place,

00:04:48.059 --> 00:04:50.259
he stabbed Do Jin in
the back and left the gang.

00:04:50.329 --> 00:04:51.699
After getting clean from gang life,

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:54.930
he's been playing the
bass guitar like crazy.

00:04:56.829 --> 00:04:57.869
Listen up.

00:04:59.369 --> 00:05:00.869
People betray...

00:05:01.769 --> 00:05:02.869
for three reasons.

00:05:03.769 --> 00:05:05.540
The first reason is that
they found a better gang.

00:05:06.939 --> 00:05:07.979
The second reason is
that their life is threatened,

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:09.009
so they have no choice.

00:05:10.449 --> 00:05:11.480
The third reason is that...

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:14.249
they found something they love so much...

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:15.889
that they're willing
to risk their lives for.

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:17.719
Guys, didn't Hyun Yul come with you?

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:20.159
That jerk. He has to remain a
traitor to the end, doesn't he?

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:21.160
Hey, what are you doing?

00:05:21.161 --> 00:05:22.559
Didn't you hear him calling you a traitor?

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:25.459
Darn, what happened to his face?

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.930
I fought with a Jindo dog
while putting up the poster.

00:05:32.269 --> 00:05:34.198
Whatever the reason may
be, one thing will remain certain.

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:35.568
It was a good fight.

00:05:35.569 --> 00:05:36.709
That very reason...

00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:39.879
will be their weakness.

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:01.199

- Okay. See you later!

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:04.300
- Gosh. Let's take a break.
- Let's take a break.

00:06:05.269 --> 00:06:06.269
Guys.

00:06:08.069 --> 00:06:11.009
We have the T-shirts for Watermelon Sugar!

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:15.208
- Hey, this looks so cool!
- Let me see.

00:06:15.209 --> 00:06:17.308
- Why are you taking off your pants?
- Hold on a second.

00:06:17.309 --> 00:06:19.078
- Oh, my!
- Hey, this is mine.

00:06:19.079 --> 00:06:20.720
- Gosh.
- Hey.

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:23.019
Were you putting that on or taking it off?

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:24.859
If you were taking it off, stop it.

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:26.388
If you were putting it
on, put it on already.

00:06:26.389 --> 00:06:27.420
We don't have much time.

00:06:27.889 --> 00:06:29.958
All right. Let's doll up...

00:06:29.959 --> 00:06:31.430
and take pictures for the poster.

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:41.069

- Hey!

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:44.540

- Hey!
- Hey!

00:06:52.449 --> 00:06:54.119
What? No way

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:57.050
Is the sun already up?

00:06:59.389 --> 00:07:01.160
It's bright

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:04.030
Outside the window now

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:08.300
There's a spring

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:11.569

00:07:13.569 --> 00:07:15.269

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:37.258
Put your arms around each other.

00:07:37.259 --> 00:07:38.558
- Our arms?
- In 1, 2, 3.

00:07:38.559 --> 00:07:40.600
- Sugar!
- Sugar!

00:07:44.699 --> 00:07:46.539
- Left foot, right foot.
- Right foot.

00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:47.868
- You're doing it way too fast.
- Fix your feet.

00:07:47.869 --> 00:07:49.438
I said, "right foot!"

00:07:49.439 --> 00:07:50.470
I see, my right foot.

00:07:55.079 --> 00:07:56.309
One more. Okay.

00:08:01.249 --> 00:08:04.220
Wait! Let's get you guys freshened up.

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:07.490
- Right here.
- Okay. Great.

00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:09.030
Put it on top.

00:08:09.389 --> 00:08:11.329
- Gosh, that's great.
- It's nice.

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:44.900
All right. Let's do this.

00:08:46.229 --> 00:08:48.469
In 1, 2, 3.

00:08:48.729 --> 00:08:49.799
Jump!

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:50.969
- Yes!
- Yes!

Aren't they First Love Memory Manipulators?

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:15.790
Yes, they are. They are The Manipulators.

00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:19.129
I thought their club had disbanded
after losing the clubroom to us.

00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:20.659
Who was it?

00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:22.599
Who said our band was disbanded?

00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:00.198

Hey, does it mean Choi Se
Gyeong will be coming to the festival?

00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:04.039
Hey, we had a bet about that.
Sung Ho will lose for sure now.

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:06.238
- Hey. Tell us already.
- I bet ten dollars.

00:10:06.239 --> 00:10:08.209
- I bet 10 dollars.
- I bet 20.

- Gosh.
- Oh, my.

Are you sure? You'll really go to
Baekwang High School's festival?

00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:24.660
I'm not sure. What should I do?

00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:26.429
Which one will you pick?

00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:27.930
Ha Eun Gyeol? Ha Yi Chan?

00:10:28.059 --> 00:10:30.900
I'm not sure. Which one should I pick?

00:10:31.199 --> 00:10:32.800
Enough with the suspense. Tell us already.

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:34.699
Which one will you pick?

00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:36.539
Can't you just pick Ha Yi Chan?

00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:38.780
Leave Ha Eun Gyeol alone, so
he can be a public asset. Please?

00:10:39.339 --> 00:10:41.239
- A public asset?
- Yes.

00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:43.848
Every household needs someone like him.

00:10:43.849 --> 00:10:45.949
You can't have him all to
yourself. That's not nice. You know?

00:10:46.250 --> 00:10:48.150
Let the humanitarian
side of you shine. Please.

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:57.160

00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:10.270

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.170
You're pretty athletic.

00:12:16.510 --> 00:12:17.540
You saw me play.

00:12:18.239 --> 00:12:20.078
Actually, I've been training at the gym...

00:12:20.079 --> 00:12:21.309
since I was a kid because of my brother.

00:12:21.439 --> 00:12:22.608
When I did taekwondo,

00:12:22.609 --> 00:12:23.780
they offered me to be on the national team.

00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:29.420
What? Is something on my face?

00:12:30.390 --> 00:12:33.160
I noticed that you tend
to smile quite easily.

00:12:33.890 --> 00:12:34.890
I do?

00:12:34.959 --> 00:12:37.358
Puppies wag their tails
whenever they see people.

00:12:37.359 --> 00:12:39.630
And you smile whenever you see girls.

00:12:40.329 --> 00:12:42.229
Smiling at everyone must not be easy.

00:12:42.530 --> 00:12:45.640
So why don't I rip that
mouth of yours instead?

00:12:46.969 --> 00:12:48.640
I think that was a threat.

00:12:49.010 --> 00:12:50.770
Please tell me I'm mistaken.

00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:52.180
Get a grip.

00:12:52.579 --> 00:12:54.209
We have two days until the festival.

00:12:54.780 --> 00:12:56.409
Some kids bet their money
on this. For their sake,

00:12:56.410 --> 00:12:57.849
we should keep the suspense alive.

00:12:58.750 --> 00:12:59.780
"The suspense?"

00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:01.550
What suspense?

00:13:02.349 --> 00:13:04.818
Hey, you should be
hoping that I choose you.

00:13:04.819 --> 00:13:06.859
If you're that indifferent,
there won't be any suspense!

00:13:08.530 --> 00:13:10.259
This isn't fun or touching.

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:12.030
And it won't leave an
impression on anyone. Darn it!

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:22.770
What? What is it? What's
wrong? Are you okay?

00:13:23.270 --> 00:13:24.468
What's wrong? What is it?

00:13:24.469 --> 00:13:26.809
- Get me some water.
- Okay.

00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:28.179
What's wrong? Are you okay?

00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:29.209
Did something get stuck in your throat?

00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:37.290
Gosh. I almost died, seriously.

00:13:38.219 --> 00:13:40.260
I can't eat spicy food.

00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:44.459
He can't eat spicy food?

00:13:59.439 --> 00:14:01.780
- Is this spicy for you?
- Isn't it spicy for you?

00:14:01.949 --> 00:14:04.280
This isn't spicy at all. Even
newborn babies can eat this!

00:14:04.979 --> 00:14:06.919
Hey, how could newborn babies eat this?

00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:08.119
You're an idiot with no spice tolerance.

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:09.849
You're a fool who can't
even eat spicy food!

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:14.760
What?

00:14:15.689 --> 00:14:17.359
She should tell me what I did wrong.

00:14:18.859 --> 00:14:19.859
What was that?

00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:21.160
This is crazy.

00:14:21.359 --> 00:14:23.328
Why are you disappointed? Are you IU?

00:14:23.329 --> 00:14:24.800
Is he your mister?

00:14:24.969 --> 00:14:26.040
Get a grip.

00:14:26.339 --> 00:14:27.838
He's a middle-aged man
who's the same age as my mom.

00:14:27.839 --> 00:14:30.839
I'm here to find my
mom's first love, not mine.

00:14:31.010 --> 00:14:32.239
What on earth are you doing?

00:14:36.209 --> 00:14:38.780
Gosh. Come on, why
couldn't he just eat spicy food?

00:14:48.589 --> 00:14:50.789
- I'm hungry.
- Did you know?

00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:52.630
Guys!

00:14:53.829 --> 00:14:55.130
Everyone, gather around for a second.

00:14:55.270 --> 00:14:57.568
The festival committee just
decided on the order of the rehearsal.

00:14:57.569 --> 00:14:59.800
- Really? When will we perform?
- What about us?

00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:03.010
We'll rehearse tomorrow at 3pm in the gym.

00:15:03.069 --> 00:15:05.708
- Yes! Nice!
- Yes! Okay!

00:15:05.709 --> 00:15:08.849
- Stop!
- Okay.

00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:10.608
Don't forget.

00:15:10.609 --> 00:15:13.019
That's the only time we can rehearse.

00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:14.078
Don't be late.

00:15:14.079 --> 00:15:15.948
Needless to say that you
must be there too. Okay?

00:15:15.949 --> 00:15:18.188
- Okay!
- Okay!

00:15:18.189 --> 00:15:19.290
- Okay.
- And there's more.

00:15:20.059 --> 00:15:21.619
We'll check everything such as
the lighting, the sound system,

00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:23.159
the flow of your movement,
and the order. So be ready.

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:24.488
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:15:24.489 --> 00:15:26.159
- We can do it. Okay.
- There's more.

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:27.858
My father will deliver
your stuff and instruments...

00:15:27.859 --> 00:15:29.529
with his truck tomorrow.

00:15:29.530 --> 00:15:30.568
Make sure you have everything to perform...

00:15:30.569 --> 00:15:31.598
like your outfits and so on.

00:15:31.599 --> 00:15:33.698
Check that one last time before you leave.

00:15:33.699 --> 00:15:35.870
- We got it.
- This is the most important one.

00:15:36.609 --> 00:15:38.438
You must memorize
the revised set list. Okay?

00:15:38.439 --> 00:15:40.140
Come on. You and your nagging!

00:15:40.410 --> 00:15:42.208
You're giving us an earful. That's enough.

00:15:42.209 --> 00:15:44.009
- This is how you show your anger.
- Is that so?

00:15:44.010 --> 00:15:45.520
Then I'll have the meat alone.

00:15:45.979 --> 00:15:47.348
- Meat?
- Meat?

00:15:47.349 --> 00:15:48.420
Well, you know,

00:15:48.819 --> 00:15:51.448
our number one fan wanted
to treat us to a barbecue meal.

00:15:51.449 --> 00:15:52.689
I'll go by myself.

00:15:53.559 --> 00:15:55.659
- Hey! Wait up!
- Hey! No!

00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:57.930
- Who's our number one fan?
- Hey! Who is it?

00:15:58.829 --> 00:16:01.900
May Watermelon Sugar
have a successful début.

00:16:03.069 --> 00:16:04.630
Let's grease our pipes now.

00:16:07.099 --> 00:16:09.468
- Sit down.
- Here I go to grease my pipes.

00:16:09.469 --> 00:16:11.239
- Yes, meat!
- Right here.

00:16:11.569 --> 00:16:12.909
I like my meat with the sesame oil.

00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:14.238
- Try it.
- Gosh.

00:16:14.239 --> 00:16:15.280
How is it?

00:16:16.410 --> 00:16:17.979
- It's so good.
- Right?

00:16:19.079 --> 00:16:21.149
This is a special present
for the band manager...

00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:23.620
who must have worked
so hard behind the scenes.

00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:25.319
This isn't pork. It's beef.

00:16:25.559 --> 00:16:28.160
- Gosh.
- Thank you!

00:16:28.219 --> 00:16:29.228
I agree.

00:16:29.229 --> 00:16:31.059
We couldn't have made
it this far without him.

00:16:31.959 --> 00:16:33.058
I won't take your food.

00:16:33.059 --> 00:16:34.400
- Then I will.
- Hey.

00:16:35.229 --> 00:16:37.130
Aren't you disappointed that
you won't be performing on stage?

00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:40.140
Not really.

00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:42.439
Maybe, it's because I'm
the son of a merchant.

00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:44.909
Gathering people to launch a project,

00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:46.409
promoting the event,
and negotiating deals...

00:16:46.410 --> 00:16:47.539
are more fun for me.

00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:50.609
Gosh. That's the mind of a music producer.

00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:52.679
A music producer? What do they do?

00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:54.578
They make and promote albums.

00:16:54.579 --> 00:16:56.120
And they're also in charge
of managing the funds.

00:16:56.390 --> 00:16:58.119
There's a job like that?

00:16:58.120 --> 00:16:59.218
Of course.

00:16:59.219 --> 00:17:02.228
A and R representatives
are popular abroad nowadays.

00:17:02.229 --> 00:17:03.790
I think that will suit you too.

00:17:03.959 --> 00:17:05.760
A and R representatives? What's that now?

00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:08.160
They discover promising artists.

00:17:08.359 --> 00:17:11.699
And they find and form
repertoires suitable for those artists.

00:17:12.270 --> 00:17:14.000
John Kalodner is the most
famous A and R executive.

00:17:14.599 --> 00:17:16.869
- John Kalodner?
- I see.

00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:18.539
- John what? Coriander?
- That's the perfect job for you.

00:17:18.910 --> 00:17:19.938
- You think so?
- Yes.

00:17:19.939 --> 00:17:20.939
You think that job suits me?

00:17:22.249 --> 00:17:24.580
What do you think? Do
you think I'll be good at that?

00:17:24.979 --> 00:17:25.979
You?

00:17:27.620 --> 00:17:28.989
You'll be marvellous at it.

00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:31.090
Marvellous Ma Joo!

00:17:32.189 --> 00:17:33.360
As for the name of your company,

00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:36.659
how about MJ? Those are your initials.

00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:38.228
- MJ.
- MJ.

00:17:38.229 --> 00:17:39.559
- MJ.
- Ma Joo.

00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:41.999
That's nice! It sounds quite fancy.

00:17:42.529 --> 00:17:43.729
Do make your own company later.

00:17:43.930 --> 00:17:45.570
I'll send you a fancy
plant to congratulate you.

00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:47.840
Come on. Instead of a plant,

00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:50.539
can you help me sign Yoon Dong Jin?

00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:51.939
Unbelievable.

00:17:52.209 --> 00:17:53.739
Are you already done
mapping out your new business?

00:17:54.539 --> 00:17:56.579
Seeing how you want to sign Yoon Dong Jin,

00:17:56.580 --> 00:17:57.610
you're an ambitious boy.

00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:00.080
- Keep eating.
- You know...

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:01.080
who Yoon Dong Jin is, right?

00:18:01.219 --> 00:18:03.548
Of course, I do. He's the
godfather of Korean band music.

00:18:03.549 --> 00:18:05.958
Oh Ma Joo is the one who
helped Yoon Dong Jin...

00:18:05.959 --> 00:18:07.519
become the number
one artist in the country.

00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:09.989
Oh Ma Joo has been his
manager since he was a nobody.

00:18:10.529 --> 00:18:11.958
So that was when you met...

00:18:11.959 --> 00:18:13.630
Mr. Oh Ma Joo for the first time, right?

00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:16.729
That's right. I can't believe
it's been 29 years already.

00:18:16.969 --> 00:18:19.238
Then are any of the other
co-members still working...

00:18:19.239 --> 00:18:20.839
in the music industry?

00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:23.239
- No one. I'm the only one.
- My gosh.

00:18:24.709 --> 00:18:26.978
Unfortunately, we had to
disband after a short while...

00:18:26.979 --> 00:18:28.810
because my bandmate got
himself into serious trouble.

00:18:29.549 --> 00:18:31.508
Because of that, our gig at
the festival was cancelled...

00:18:31.509 --> 00:18:33.219
and we disbanded.

00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:36.519
All that was left was a
relationship with Ma Joo.

00:18:36.949 --> 00:18:39.218
He must've caused serious trouble...

00:18:39.219 --> 00:18:40.890
if you even had to disband.

00:18:43.289 --> 00:18:44.360
It was serious.

00:18:44.959 --> 00:18:46.100
Because one of my bandmates...

00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:48.930
was hurt badly.

00:18:49.229 --> 00:18:50.698
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

00:18:50.699 --> 00:18:51.769
- MJ.
- Hey.

00:18:52.939 --> 00:18:53.999
What's the matter?

00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:57.410
Do you remember when it happened?

00:18:57.709 --> 00:19:00.739
Of course, I remember clearly.

00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:04.880
It was May 1995, a day before the festival.

00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:07.920
It happened during a rehearsal.

00:19:08.479 --> 00:19:09.820
I forgot...

00:19:10.219 --> 00:19:12.560
that First Love Memory Manipulators...

00:19:13.090 --> 00:19:14.719
originally had Yoon Dong Jin.

00:19:15.789 --> 00:19:16.829
And...

00:19:16.830 --> 00:19:18.699
It's a pity.

00:19:18.959 --> 00:19:22.400
I sent a helper that is perfect for you.

00:19:22.699 --> 00:19:26.640
If the helper Master was
talking about was Dong Jin...

00:19:27.670 --> 00:19:30.109
If his interview...

00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:31.640
was the hint for the
date of the accident...

00:19:32.209 --> 00:19:35.610
If the one who was badly
hurt during the rehearsal...

00:19:36.479 --> 00:19:37.509
was my dad...

00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:42.489
What's the matter? You're scaring me.

00:19:42.890 --> 00:19:44.019
Do you have something to say to me?

00:19:44.219 --> 00:19:46.890
My dad will get into an accident
tomorrow, the rehearsal day.

00:19:49.989 --> 00:19:52.059
Hey, where are you going?

00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:53.100
You were in the middle of a barbecue party.

00:20:07.110 --> 00:20:08.479
Come on. Pick it up!

00:20:09.910 --> 00:20:10.949
You can hear me, right?

00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:12.719
You're listening, aren't you?

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:15.080
Is the helper you were
talking about Yoon Dong Jin?

00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:17.689
Is the one who will get hurt
during the rehearsal tomorrow...

00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:19.560
my dad?

00:20:22.259 --> 00:20:23.959
Answer me. Please.

00:20:25.029 --> 00:20:26.959
What in the world will happen tomorrow?

00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:29.499
Who will get hurt?

00:20:29.969 --> 00:20:32.670
Who will cause the accident? Please.

00:20:33.870 --> 00:20:35.369
I'm full.

00:20:35.370 --> 00:20:37.509
It feels like I'm pregnant
with a whole pig.

00:20:37.670 --> 00:20:40.239
Call me when you're giving
birth. I'll hold your hand.

00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:43.708
After twists and turns,

00:20:43.709 --> 00:20:45.718
we're finally rehearsing.

00:20:45.719 --> 00:20:48.448
Why is it making me so nervous?

00:20:48.449 --> 00:20:49.948
If you're scared, just die.

00:20:49.949 --> 00:20:51.019
"Scared?"

00:20:51.249 --> 00:20:53.660
I have a burning passion.

00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:55.659
Do you want to practice more with
the energy we got from the meat?

00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:57.289
Shall we go straight to the practice room?

00:20:58.259 --> 00:20:59.529
Well, no.

00:21:00.529 --> 00:21:02.799
I, the genius who is amazing
when he needs to be, will get going.

00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:06.039
I'll get going as well.

00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:07.939
Hey.

00:21:09.209 --> 00:21:11.840
You're more like a party
pooper than a genius, aren't you?

00:21:11.939 --> 00:21:12.979
I'm sorry.

00:21:13.110 --> 00:21:15.649
I should take care of my
skin for a couple of days.

00:21:15.650 --> 00:21:17.850
So I need to sleep when
my skin is regenerated.

00:21:18.049 --> 00:21:19.349
Are you participating in Miss Korea?

00:21:19.350 --> 00:21:21.018
I need to look great under the light...

00:21:21.019 --> 00:21:22.320
to get chosen by Se Gyeong.

00:21:33.799 --> 00:21:37.070
Do Jin will be discharged temporarily soon.

00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:39.539
You'd better watch your six at night.

00:21:40.199 --> 00:21:41.739
Or you might get stabbed from behind.

00:22:13.439 --> 00:22:15.499
Gosh.

00:22:18.170 --> 00:22:19.239
Who are you?

00:22:19.610 --> 00:22:20.709
I'm sorry.

00:22:20.910 --> 00:22:23.208
I wanted to thank you for last time.

00:22:23.209 --> 00:22:25.380
But I didn't have the courage.

00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:32.619
Are you a fish or what?

00:22:32.620 --> 00:22:34.090
Why do you bite the bait so easily?

00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:38.590
Thank you so much for last time.

00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:41.330
I will make sure to go and
cheer for you at the festival.

00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:43.130
Good luck.

00:22:43.229 --> 00:22:46.039
Good luck. Okay. Hurry up and go.

00:22:46.370 --> 00:22:47.968
Okay. Bye.

00:22:47.969 --> 00:22:49.209
- Okay.
- Go.

00:23:04.989 --> 00:23:07.890
Don't worry, Hyun
Yul. It's not the time yet.

00:23:08.719 --> 00:23:11.390
Because it's more fun
to trample on a garden...

00:23:11.729 --> 00:23:12.759
when the flowers are in full bloom.

00:23:20.070 --> 00:23:21.140
You got me surprised.

00:23:21.739 --> 00:23:22.769
What is it?

00:23:23.039 --> 00:23:25.409
Did you get touched by the
pork and meet the pig farmer?

00:23:25.410 --> 00:23:26.410
Yi Chan.

00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:28.279
I have a favour.

00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:30.449
And I hope you grant me that.

00:23:30.549 --> 00:23:32.248
Stop with the serious voice.

00:23:32.249 --> 00:23:34.449
What is it? Do you want
to eat my grandma's food?

00:23:35.519 --> 00:23:37.219
Let's not rehearse tomorrow.

00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:44.859
There's a dog who can
understand you over there.

00:23:44.860 --> 00:23:45.860
You can talk to it.

00:23:49.029 --> 00:23:50.729
We've been practicing a lot.

00:23:51.330 --> 00:23:52.869
Even if we don't rehearse tomorrow,

00:23:52.870 --> 00:23:54.839
we'll have no problem at the festival.

00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:55.870
So...

00:23:56.209 --> 00:23:58.339
Why do you do this every time?

00:23:58.340 --> 00:24:00.439
I'm not saying that we
shouldn't perform at all.

00:24:01.009 --> 00:24:02.548
I'm just telling you to skip
the rehearsal tomorrow.

00:24:02.549 --> 00:24:03.749
So...

00:24:04.049 --> 00:24:05.208
why do you not want to do...

00:24:05.209 --> 00:24:07.279
the only rehearsal we
have before the concert?

00:24:07.719 --> 00:24:09.620
You must have a reason.

00:24:12.719 --> 00:24:14.789
It's something that I
can't explain in words.

00:24:15.890 --> 00:24:17.430
So please trust me...

00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:19.929
and do me a favour.

00:24:19.930 --> 00:24:20.930
Why?

00:24:21.029 --> 00:24:23.469
Are you an alien on a mission or something?

00:24:23.630 --> 00:24:25.698
Should our band fail for
you to conquer the universe?

00:24:25.699 --> 00:24:28.140
- Yi Chan.
- What's next after the rehearsal?

00:24:28.670 --> 00:24:29.910
Are you going to ask me
not to perform at the festival?

00:24:30.810 --> 00:24:32.340
Are you going to ask me to die after that?

00:24:32.910 --> 00:24:35.438
And I should trust you and
do you a favour every time?

00:24:35.439 --> 00:24:36.548
Yi Chan.

00:24:36.549 --> 00:24:38.079
Have some professionalism.

00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:39.380
Just, please.

00:24:39.850 --> 00:24:41.879
It's a high school band
you made to pick up a girl.

00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:43.619
What professionalism should I have?

00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:44.620
Hey!

00:24:49.759 --> 00:24:50.759
I got it.

00:24:51.890 --> 00:24:54.729
Let's do it.

00:24:55.330 --> 00:24:56.330
But...

00:24:58.330 --> 00:25:00.469
you should not come.

00:25:01.699 --> 00:25:05.340
We'll rehearse by ourselves tomorrow.

00:25:07.110 --> 00:25:08.209
Let's stop it.

00:25:09.410 --> 00:25:11.009
I can't understand a single word you say.

00:25:11.279 --> 00:25:13.120
Yi Chan, please.

00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:14.679
You looked like you
had an ulterior motive...

00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:15.749
when you joined the
band from the beginning.

00:25:17.019 --> 00:25:18.350
You acted like you were all pure,

00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:21.019
innocent, and truthful.

00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:22.629
But it felt like there
were some impurities...

00:25:22.630 --> 00:25:24.259
at the bottom of your heart.

00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:26.430
I was curious, but I didn't ask.

00:25:26.959 --> 00:25:28.559
I was uneasy, but I left it alone.

00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:30.268
Because I didn't want the
other guys to be affected...

00:25:30.269 --> 00:25:31.929
by stirring it for no reason.

00:25:31.930 --> 00:25:34.969
So I just left it so
that it could stay clear.

00:25:35.370 --> 00:25:38.009
But until the end,

00:25:38.539 --> 00:25:40.779
until the very end,

00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:43.749
do you have to ruin it like this?

00:25:44.979 --> 00:25:47.279
Yi Chan, please.

00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:49.189
Okay. Don't do it.

00:25:49.949 --> 00:25:51.049
You don't have to do it.

00:25:52.150 --> 00:25:54.489
But I'll do it. No matter what.

00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:56.229
I'll do it no matter what happens.

00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:02.599
Yi Chan.

00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:04.299
Open the door.

00:26:20.519 --> 00:26:22.590
What do I do? How do I stop it?

00:26:23.090 --> 00:26:24.649
How do I stop him?

00:26:24.650 --> 00:26:26.719
Should I lock him up? Should I tie him up?

00:26:27.060 --> 00:26:29.289
Should I knock him
out? Should I kidnap him?

00:26:29.860 --> 00:26:30.930
Or...

00:26:36.469 --> 00:26:39.939
If he's the same age as my
mom, he must be in his mid-40s.

00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:43.709
I'm sure he looks much
worse now because of old age.

00:26:43.910 --> 00:26:46.679
He must have a big
belly and be losing hair.

00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:49.410
He might be wearing toe socks
because he has an athlete's foot.

00:26:50.410 --> 00:26:52.879
His pores would be as big as a schoolyard.

00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:55.150
And his skin would be
oily with all the pores.

00:26:57.449 --> 00:26:58.920
This is a reality check.

00:27:00.090 --> 00:27:01.860
I don't like him anymore.

00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:18.239
Who is it?

00:27:18.410 --> 00:27:19.580
It's me. Eun Gyeol.

00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:23.509
Can we talk for a moment if you don't mind?

00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:34.320
My gosh. What should I do?

00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:55.439
I was asleep. What's up?

00:27:55.979 --> 00:27:57.150
I'm sorry to bother you so late.

00:27:57.650 --> 00:27:59.109
I have a favour to ask.

00:27:59.110 --> 00:28:00.380
Can you please do me a favour?

00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:03.689
Oh, but I see that you came empty-handed.

00:28:04.219 --> 00:28:05.689
If you came to ask a favour,

00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:07.759
I suggest you come back
with gifts in both hands.

00:28:08.759 --> 00:28:09.860
Help me, please.

00:28:14.259 --> 00:28:15.499
It's something only you can do.

00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:21.239
Please help me.

00:28:25.039 --> 00:28:26.239

Se Gyeong!

00:29:06.049 --> 00:29:07.049
Se Gyeong.

00:29:08.380 --> 00:29:09.489
Se Gyeong, you made it.

00:29:10.620 --> 00:29:11.749
What's he doing?

00:29:21.229 --> 00:29:22.829
- Choose one!
- Choose one!

00:29:22.830 --> 00:29:25.899
- Choose one!
- Choose one!

00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:27.439
- Choose one!
- Choose one!

00:29:27.769 --> 00:29:29.410
- Choose one!
- I'm here to keep my promise.

00:29:30.439 --> 00:29:33.009
Se Gyeong. I'll respect your
decision, no matter whom you pick.

00:29:34.009 --> 00:29:36.650
Se Gyeong. It's me,
right? You'll pick me, right?

00:29:39.479 --> 00:29:40.580
My choice is...

00:29:44.549 --> 00:29:45.549
Yi Chan.

00:29:47.789 --> 00:29:49.120
Yes. Go ahead, Se Gyeong.

00:29:49.989 --> 00:29:51.029
Answer your phone.

00:29:52.289 --> 00:29:53.330
What?

00:29:55.729 --> 00:29:56.900
Answer your phone.

00:29:57.330 --> 00:29:59.130
Yi Chan, answer the phone!

00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:04.209
- Gosh.
- Yi Chan! Answer it!

00:30:05.610 --> 00:30:07.709
Hey, Yi Chan. Hurry up!

00:30:09.610 --> 00:30:11.610
Yi Chan! Answer it, will you?

00:30:16.590 --> 00:30:17.650
Hello?

00:30:17.789 --> 00:30:19.788
Oh, I'm sorry. I woke you up, didn't I?

00:30:19.789 --> 00:30:20.890
It's me, Se Gyeong.

00:30:21.789 --> 00:30:22.789
My gosh.

00:30:23.330 --> 00:30:26.400
Se Gyeong, what's up?
Why are you calling so early?

00:30:26.660 --> 00:30:28.060
Well, the thing is...

00:30:28.999 --> 00:30:30.870
There's a bit of a situation.

00:30:30.969 --> 00:30:32.170
Why? What is it?

00:30:32.499 --> 00:30:34.339
What happened? Are you feeling sick?

00:30:34.340 --> 00:30:36.570
- Are you hurt?
- No, it's not that.

00:30:36.810 --> 00:30:40.139
The photo cards we were going
to give out with the pamphlets.

00:30:40.140 --> 00:30:42.279
Yes, what about them?

00:30:43.709 --> 00:30:45.549
The other guys' photo
cards turned out great,

00:30:46.049 --> 00:30:49.549
but your photo is... How should I put this?

00:30:52.350 --> 00:30:53.459
I'll just be honest.

00:30:54.219 --> 00:30:56.729
It doesn't even show one percent of
your charms. It makes me so upset.

00:30:58.860 --> 00:31:01.660
Oh, I see. That's okay, Se Gyeong.

00:31:01.799 --> 00:31:03.199
I look much hotter in person anyway.

00:31:03.769 --> 00:31:06.699
Well, that's true. But I was going
to keep one if it turned out nicely.

00:31:06.799 --> 00:31:09.239
My gosh. You wanted one for yourself?

00:31:10.209 --> 00:31:11.238
You wanted to keep my photo?

00:31:11.239 --> 00:31:13.209
Yes, I was even planning
on getting it laminated.

00:31:13.709 --> 00:31:16.380
That being said, I was hoping to
do a separate photoshoot with you.

00:31:16.650 --> 00:31:18.048
That'd be too much to ask, right?

00:31:18.049 --> 00:31:19.419
No, not at all!

00:31:19.420 --> 00:31:21.920
Of course, I can do it. Let's do it!

00:31:22.049 --> 00:31:23.049
Really?

00:31:23.050 --> 00:31:25.620
I'm relieved. I was worried you'd say no.

00:31:26.090 --> 00:31:27.218
The thing is,

00:31:27.219 --> 00:31:29.629
today is the only day I can do it.
Are you okay with skipping school?

00:31:29.630 --> 00:31:30.789
Yes, sure thing.

00:31:31.229 --> 00:31:33.129
I can skip a day of school...

00:31:33.130 --> 00:31:35.160
because school will always be there.

00:31:38.499 --> 00:31:40.070
What? Oh, hold on.

00:31:41.499 --> 00:31:43.139
That's right. Today...

00:31:43.140 --> 00:31:45.269
I know. Your rehearsal is at 3pm, right?

00:31:45.439 --> 00:31:46.939
We'll be back before then.

00:31:47.180 --> 00:31:48.479
Really?

00:31:52.779 --> 00:31:55.320
Then where shall I meet
you? Where are we meeting?

00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:24.479
Boleum Island. It's an island
not too far from Incheon.

00:32:35.289 --> 00:32:36.330
Here.

00:32:36.989 --> 00:32:38.160
Let me carry this for you.

00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:41.699
You should've asked me for help.

00:32:42.299 --> 00:32:43.999
I got this too.

00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:45.468
My gosh. Thank you.

00:32:45.469 --> 00:32:46.570
Where are you headed anyway?

00:32:57.410 --> 00:32:59.920
I'm from Seoul. Yes,
I'm visiting from Seoul.

00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:01.449
Oh, thank you.

00:33:02.019 --> 00:33:04.150
I discovered a fantastic spot on
the island that can showcase...

00:33:04.420 --> 00:33:06.258
your masculine charm in addition to...

00:33:06.259 --> 00:33:07.759
your youthful, mischievous vibes.

00:33:09.459 --> 00:33:12.059
I'll get there first to set up
the camera and wait for you.

00:33:12.060 --> 00:33:13.130
Don't be late.

00:33:13.459 --> 00:33:14.860
Se Gyeong!

00:33:15.130 --> 00:33:16.900
I'm here!

00:33:17.229 --> 00:33:20.698
Wait just a bit longer!

00:33:20.699 --> 00:33:24.669
Wait just a bit longer!

00:33:24.670 --> 00:33:25.969
Se Gyeong!

00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:28.110
I'm here!

00:33:28.380 --> 00:33:32.309
Wait just a bit longer!

00:33:32.310 --> 00:33:33.749
Se Gyeong!

00:33:35.850 --> 00:33:37.920
Gosh, this is why they
say you should never sin.

00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:47.299
Why should I dupe Yi Chan like that?

00:33:48.830 --> 00:33:50.769
Someone's life depends
on this. It's very important.

00:33:51.699 --> 00:33:54.499
You're being cryptic. I'm not
convinced. Give me another reason.

00:33:58.039 --> 00:33:59.639
I have a secret that I
can't share with you.

00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:01.840
You already told me that when
we went to the amusement park.

00:34:02.110 --> 00:34:03.549
It won't work. I need
to hear another reason.

00:34:03.709 --> 00:34:06.879
Come on. Can you please
just help me? Please.

00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:08.680
Tell me another reason.

00:34:26.569 --> 00:34:28.270
Okay, I'll help you.

00:34:29.339 --> 00:34:31.739
Silence can also impart a message.

00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:34.209
You're desperate. You have good
intentions and don't mean any harm.

00:34:34.210 --> 00:34:35.609
I can feel all of it.

00:34:35.710 --> 00:34:37.810
Really? Are you really going to help me?

00:34:39.009 --> 00:34:41.419
You said it was important and
that someone's life depended on it.

00:34:42.219 --> 00:34:43.949
It doesn't sound like a joke.

00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:45.689
You seem desperate.

00:34:45.690 --> 00:34:47.989
I can't ignore that just because it
doesn't look like a big deal to me.

00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:50.588
"I know how it feels..."

00:34:50.589 --> 00:34:52.759
"when you have your
reasons but can't say them."

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:55.500
That's what you said at the jokbal place.

00:34:56.060 --> 00:34:57.168
My reason is the same.

00:34:57.169 --> 00:34:59.028
Thanks. Seriously, thanks a lot.

00:34:59.029 --> 00:35:01.169
- I promise I'll repay you...
- But...

00:35:03.310 --> 00:35:04.810
what will you do for me?

00:35:05.910 --> 00:35:08.140
- What?
- Give and take.

00:35:08.310 --> 00:35:09.540
It's the most basic rule of deal-making.

00:35:10.879 --> 00:35:11.949
Sure.

00:35:12.549 --> 00:35:15.049
Tell me what you want. I'll make
it happen if it's something I can do.

00:35:18.390 --> 00:35:19.890
I have two things, and
they're both pretty big.

00:35:21.660 --> 00:35:22.919
Can you handle them?

00:35:24.330 --> 00:35:25.359
There are two things?

00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:29.500
Yes, sure thing. I'll do my best.

00:35:31.870 --> 00:35:32.898
First.

00:35:32.899 --> 00:35:35.500
You know, the secret you
can't share with anyone.

00:35:35.870 --> 00:35:39.239
Promise me that you'll
tell me all about it later on.

00:35:39.710 --> 00:35:40.710
But that's...

00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:46.680
Okay, I promise.

00:35:48.719 --> 00:35:49.719
What's the second one?

00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:53.319
This one is really huge.

00:35:53.660 --> 00:35:55.160
- Shall I brace myself?
- Yes.

00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:57.430
It's a really big one.

00:36:02.029 --> 00:36:04.270
Tomorrow, we'll go to the movies
and wrap up the day together. Deal?

00:36:06.399 --> 00:36:07.469
Deal.

00:36:07.799 --> 00:36:10.140
With cola and popcorn. Deal?

00:36:11.609 --> 00:36:13.080
- Yes, we have a deal.
- Great.

00:36:19.750 --> 00:36:20.879
Excellent.

00:36:21.149 --> 00:36:24.089
See? It sounds much
better after a little practice.

00:36:24.890 --> 00:36:27.818
Skip a day of practice, and your
hard work can go down the drain.

00:36:27.819 --> 00:36:29.060
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:36:29.319 --> 00:36:30.890
That said, Se Gyeong.

00:36:31.129 --> 00:36:32.830
Keep your promise and play...

00:36:34.460 --> 00:36:35.729
Where did Se Gyeong go?

00:36:35.730 --> 00:36:37.870
She was here and she wasn't.

00:36:48.580 --> 00:36:50.250
(Feeling the heart flutter)

00:37:14.370 --> 00:37:15.569
Are you skipping your class too?

00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:20.080
Why are you here alone?
Where's everyone else?

00:37:21.879 --> 00:37:23.040
(English Listening Class,
Everyone, come to the language lab.)

00:37:23.449 --> 00:37:24.549
I see.

00:37:29.890 --> 00:37:32.020
What is it? Do you have
something to say to me?

00:37:38.489 --> 00:37:40.699
Whom will you choose at the festival?

00:37:46.669 --> 00:37:48.569
Why do you ask? Did you bet money too?

00:37:51.140 --> 00:37:53.410
Really? Which one?

00:37:53.980 --> 00:37:54.980
It's a secret.

00:37:55.580 --> 00:37:57.509
Oh, I see that you're serious about this.

00:37:57.710 --> 00:37:59.210
You must've bet quite a bit of money.

00:38:06.890 --> 00:38:09.830
Which one did I like more
before I left to go study abroad?

00:38:12.129 --> 00:38:13.759
Well, it's just that...

00:38:14.100 --> 00:38:16.629
I was curious what other people thought.

00:38:18.330 --> 00:38:19.500
Oh, sorry.

00:38:21.969 --> 00:38:24.810
I was curious what others thought.

00:38:25.270 --> 00:38:26.680
What did you think?

00:38:27.080 --> 00:38:30.379
Who was more my type before I left?

00:38:30.879 --> 00:38:33.250
Ha Yi Chan? Ha Eun Gyeol?

00:38:48.100 --> 00:38:49.159
(Ha Eun Gyeol)

00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:50.230
Ha Eun Gyeol.

00:38:51.529 --> 00:38:52.600
Ha Eun Gyeol.

00:38:55.199 --> 00:38:56.609
I see.

00:38:57.739 --> 00:38:58.870
All right.

00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:01.109
Okay.

00:39:08.549 --> 00:39:09.649
Oh, my.

00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:19.830
What? Are you here to
retake your photos too?

00:39:21.430 --> 00:39:23.469
Darn. Where's Se Gyeong?

00:39:31.940 --> 00:39:33.238
Se Gyeong isn't coming.

00:39:33.239 --> 00:39:34.609
How do you know that?

00:39:36.410 --> 00:39:38.080
- Don't tell me...
- That's right.

00:39:38.580 --> 00:39:40.219
I asked Se Gyeong...

00:39:40.719 --> 00:39:42.149
to call you here.

00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:45.049
So you manipulated me through Se Gyeong?

00:39:45.549 --> 00:39:48.460
Why are you taking it this far?

00:39:48.620 --> 00:39:50.930
I must make sure the rehearsal
won't take place, no matter what.

00:39:51.390 --> 00:39:52.390
What?

00:39:52.391 --> 00:39:54.560
I pleaded with you,
but you wouldn't listen.

00:39:55.699 --> 00:39:58.069
I can't give you any rational
reasons or convince you.

00:39:58.469 --> 00:40:00.640
You're crazy. I'm off.

00:40:01.569 --> 00:40:03.940
You'll have to wait until 6pm
if you want to leave this island.

00:40:06.239 --> 00:40:07.440
That's when the next ferry will arrive.

00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:10.080
Why do you think I
called you to this island?

00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:14.520
Darn it.

00:40:14.919 --> 00:40:16.449
Do you think I'll give up?

00:40:17.120 --> 00:40:18.390
I'll leave before that, no matter what.

00:40:18.489 --> 00:40:20.159
I'll either borrow a fishing boat...

00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:21.859
or swim across...

00:40:24.830 --> 00:40:26.089
Hey, what are you doing?

00:40:27.129 --> 00:40:28.160
Don't go.

00:40:29.660 --> 00:40:32.029
Just give up. Please.

00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:34.940
A real man must not kneel down so easily.

00:40:35.299 --> 00:40:37.739
Get up. Hey, get up at once!

00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:39.609
There's an unfortunate
incident I want to prevent.

00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:42.680
I didn't know how I could prevent it.

00:40:44.549 --> 00:40:46.279
But now, I think I see a way.

00:40:46.750 --> 00:40:47.850
So I must seize the opportunity...

00:40:48.379 --> 00:40:50.549
and do whatever I can to prevent it.

00:40:50.949 --> 00:40:52.290
Do you have two heads?

00:40:53.290 --> 00:40:56.089
Why does everything have
to be so complicated with you?

00:40:56.489 --> 00:40:59.489
If you can't convince
me, just give up, you idiot!

00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:07.899
I came from the future.

00:41:10.870 --> 00:41:12.009
Can you believe me?

00:41:13.239 --> 00:41:15.009
I'm your son from the future.

00:41:15.980 --> 00:41:17.149
You're my dad.

00:41:18.149 --> 00:41:20.218
- Do you believe me?
- What is this, a novel?

00:41:20.219 --> 00:41:21.850
I know your future,

00:41:22.449 --> 00:41:24.589
and I found out how to change your life.

00:41:25.319 --> 00:41:26.350
Can you believe me?

00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:31.930
You'll get into an accident
at the rehearsal today.

00:41:32.589 --> 00:41:34.430
That accident will change your life,

00:41:35.029 --> 00:41:37.399
and I must prevent
the accident at all costs.

00:41:37.469 --> 00:41:39.698
Hey, this isn't funny. Stop, okay?

00:41:39.699 --> 00:41:41.069
If I prevent the accident,

00:41:41.699 --> 00:41:43.508
my life will change
too, in addition to yours.

00:41:43.509 --> 00:41:45.709
I told you to stop. This is not even funny.

00:41:45.710 --> 00:41:46.810
I...

00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:52.250
I was always lonely.

00:41:54.250 --> 00:41:56.580
I felt lonely and isolated as if I
were stuck on an island by myself...

00:41:57.690 --> 00:42:00.859
and couldn't join the world
where my family was living.

00:42:03.290 --> 00:42:04.330
But you see,

00:42:05.690 --> 00:42:07.899
I now have a chance to live
in the same world as you do.

00:42:09.629 --> 00:42:10.669
I want to seize this opportunity.

00:42:11.430 --> 00:42:13.799
What on earth are you saying?

00:42:15.569 --> 00:42:17.810
I want to keep playing music
with you like we're doing now...

00:42:19.009 --> 00:42:21.140
and see you listen to my music.

00:42:24.080 --> 00:42:26.149
The guilt from knowing
I'm safe when you're not...

00:42:28.180 --> 00:42:30.218
and feeling that I shouldn't
be happy when you're not.

00:42:30.219 --> 00:42:31.449
I wanted to let go of such guilt.

00:42:37.660 --> 00:42:41.129
I'm sorry, but I'm not a fan of novels.

00:42:43.029 --> 00:42:44.600
I have no time to waste, so I'm off.

00:42:46.230 --> 00:42:47.299
Please don't go!

00:42:47.469 --> 00:42:49.270
You can take the ferry at
6pm and take your time.

00:42:49.770 --> 00:42:51.409
If you go now, I'm going to jump!

00:42:51.410 --> 00:42:53.209
Sure, suit yourself. I won't stop you.

00:42:53.210 --> 00:42:56.040
I'm dead serious. If I can't
stop you, I'll jump off this cliff.

00:43:03.149 --> 00:43:04.390
Whatever, I don't care.

00:43:15.660 --> 00:43:17.370
Dad, you can't hear.

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:19.770
How did you know
that I fell into the water?

00:43:24.069 --> 00:43:25.509
I can't hear,

00:43:25.810 --> 00:43:27.480
but I can always see you.

00:43:28.879 --> 00:43:29.910
How?

00:43:55.469 --> 00:43:58.969
The Little Mermaid gave
her voice to the witch...

00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:01.739
in exchange for human legs.

00:44:03.279 --> 00:44:05.449
As for me, I lost my voice,

00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:08.819
but I prayed and prayed for...

00:44:10.819 --> 00:44:14.020
One, two, three.

00:44:14.259 --> 00:44:15.620
I got the third eye.

00:44:17.230 --> 00:44:20.329
Thanks to my third eye, I
can see and protect you guys...

00:44:20.330 --> 00:44:21.500
no matter where you are.

00:44:24.299 --> 00:44:26.000
See this scar here?

00:44:26.870 --> 00:44:29.000
It's the proof.

00:44:47.319 --> 00:44:48.988
Can you lower it a little more?

00:44:48.989 --> 00:44:50.019
(Sparkling Festival)

00:44:50.020 --> 00:44:51.059
Yes, that looks good.

00:44:51.060 --> 00:44:53.329
Hey, hurry up and come down!

00:44:53.330 --> 00:44:54.758
- That jerk.
- Calm down.

00:44:54.759 --> 00:44:56.358
Wait just a little longer.

00:44:56.359 --> 00:44:57.429
They'll be here shortly.

00:44:57.430 --> 00:45:00.099
Do you know how much time
we've wasted because of you guys?

00:45:00.100 --> 00:45:01.769
Come down at once unless you can start now.

00:45:01.770 --> 00:45:04.869
- Hey, calm down.
- How? Our vocalist isn't here!

00:45:04.870 --> 00:45:07.079
Hey, how about we go last?

00:45:07.080 --> 00:45:08.608
No. I won't change the order. Not a chance.

00:45:08.609 --> 00:45:10.139
Drag them out. The guitar
and everything else too!

00:45:10.140 --> 00:45:11.210
Hey, Ma Joo is here!

00:45:12.549 --> 00:45:13.750
(Baekwang High School's Sparkling Festival)

00:45:15.620 --> 00:45:18.750
Hey! What's going on with
Yi Chan and Eun Gyeol?

00:45:19.489 --> 00:45:20.789
I spoke to them just now.

00:45:20.790 --> 00:45:22.589
Are they coming or not?
That's what I need to know!

00:45:44.910 --> 00:45:47.219
You'll catch a cold
because of the ocean breeze.

00:45:51.690 --> 00:45:52.750
Here.

00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:55.859
Drink up. I got you a warm one.

00:45:56.890 --> 00:45:58.128
You really came back.

00:45:58.129 --> 00:45:59.960
I thought you'd swim and escape.

00:46:00.160 --> 00:46:01.859
I told you that I'd go to
the store and come back.

00:46:02.660 --> 00:46:04.569
Weren't you going there
to look for a fishing boat?

00:46:06.299 --> 00:46:07.569
I called Ma Joo...

00:46:08.299 --> 00:46:09.540
and told him we couldn't make it.

00:46:15.779 --> 00:46:18.149
Happy now? Are you satisfied?

00:46:31.989 --> 00:46:33.060
Hey, what's wrong?

00:46:33.730 --> 00:46:35.129
Are you feeling sick?

00:46:39.029 --> 00:46:40.029
Hey...

00:46:43.140 --> 00:46:45.770
Hey, why are you being
like this? Get off me, will you?

00:47:29.549 --> 00:47:30.790
I came from the future.

00:47:32.819 --> 00:47:33.919
Can you believe me?

00:47:34.690 --> 00:47:35.690
What a nutcase.

00:47:48.299 --> 00:47:50.140
I'm your son from the future.

00:47:51.040 --> 00:47:52.109
You're my dad.

00:47:53.239 --> 00:47:54.310
Do you believe me?

00:47:55.440 --> 00:47:56.509
He's a real nut job.

00:47:56.980 --> 00:47:58.549
Hey, I can hear you.

00:47:58.750 --> 00:48:00.519
Are you going to keep following me?

00:48:00.520 --> 00:48:01.549
Shouldn't you go home?

00:48:01.980 --> 00:48:03.419
I'm going to sleep at your place today.

00:48:03.649 --> 00:48:04.919
Enough is enough.

00:48:05.089 --> 00:48:07.489
I granted your wish and cancelled
the rehearsal, so leave me alone.

00:48:08.960 --> 00:48:10.789
To make up for cancelling the rehearsal,

00:48:10.790 --> 00:48:12.960
I'll give you a special lesson.

00:48:13.359 --> 00:48:15.128
I'll teach you my
special guitar technique...

00:48:15.129 --> 00:48:17.798
and how to look cool on stage. All of it.

00:48:17.799 --> 00:48:20.838
Oh, my. But if Se Gyeong chooses me,

00:48:20.839 --> 00:48:22.899
you'll cry again just like you did earlier.

00:48:24.969 --> 00:48:28.508
Like this? When did I cry like that?

00:48:28.509 --> 00:48:29.738
When did I do that?

00:48:29.739 --> 00:48:32.679
And there's a world of difference
between a guy who was born cool...

00:48:32.680 --> 00:48:35.019
and a guy who learned to look
cool. You're no match for me.

00:48:35.020 --> 00:48:36.479
- Do you know that?
- The latter beats the former.

00:48:36.480 --> 00:48:38.489
- Darn you...
- What? You little...

00:48:41.859 --> 00:48:44.089
Tomorrow, we'll go to the movies
and wrap up the day together. Deal?

00:48:47.830 --> 00:48:49.859
Hey, I have somewhere
to be. I'll be back soon.

00:48:50.430 --> 00:48:51.968
Okay, go. You don't need to come back.

00:48:51.969 --> 00:48:54.140
Hey, don't get sidetracked.
Go straight home.

00:48:54.969 --> 00:48:57.039
And don't leave your room, okay?

00:48:57.040 --> 00:48:59.209
You have to stay up and wait for me! Okay?

00:48:59.210 --> 00:49:00.338
I was wrong.

00:49:00.339 --> 00:49:02.040
He's a psycho, not a nutcase.

00:49:06.580 --> 00:49:07.620
I'm home...

00:49:11.419 --> 00:49:12.489
Why did you come back alone?

00:49:14.390 --> 00:49:15.890
Did you bury Eun Gyeol
somewhere on the island?

00:49:16.120 --> 00:49:17.120
What?

00:49:17.230 --> 00:49:19.190
Hey, don't say such a scary thing.

00:49:19.430 --> 00:49:21.000
Didn't you guys go there
to have a showdown?

00:49:22.730 --> 00:49:24.128
That's not our genre.

00:49:24.129 --> 00:49:25.370
Then what is your genre?

00:49:26.299 --> 00:49:28.000
Romance, melodrama, or horror?

00:49:28.199 --> 00:49:30.739
What did you guys film on that island?

00:49:32.669 --> 00:49:35.310
Human, adventure,
action, superhero fiction.

00:49:37.379 --> 00:49:39.709
Anyway, what's with you guys today?

00:49:39.710 --> 00:49:42.718
Shouldn't you have thrown things at me...

00:49:42.719 --> 00:49:45.219
and cursed me like crazy
the moment I walked in?

00:49:45.850 --> 00:49:47.919
- Is my grandma's food that good?
- Yes.

00:49:48.489 --> 00:49:51.389
We were planning to do just
that once we were done eating.

00:49:51.390 --> 00:49:53.128
And I'm done eating. What
will you do? You little rat!

00:49:53.129 --> 00:49:54.499
How dare you do this to us?

00:49:54.500 --> 00:49:56.729
- Hey!
- Hey, stop.

00:49:56.730 --> 00:49:57.929
How could you skip the rehearsal?

00:49:57.930 --> 00:49:59.769
- Hey.
- On this important day,

00:49:59.770 --> 00:50:01.968
you even seduced our
guitarist and bailed on us!

00:50:01.969 --> 00:50:03.738
Hey, that is not our genre. We were...

00:50:03.739 --> 00:50:05.508
- Get back here, you jerk.
- Hey!

00:50:05.509 --> 00:50:07.579
- I can kick you too!
- Hey!

00:50:07.580 --> 00:50:09.909
I worked hard to cook
you guys that warm meal.

00:50:09.910 --> 00:50:12.279
Must you waste your energy like this?

00:50:12.509 --> 00:50:13.579
- Thank you for the food!
- Thank you for the food!

00:50:13.580 --> 00:50:15.818
Grandma, they're so mean to me.

00:50:15.819 --> 00:50:18.290
Hey, go drop this off for Soo Bin.

00:50:18.520 --> 00:50:19.918
Again? What is this?

00:50:19.919 --> 00:50:23.389
I had some extra kimchi, so I rinsed
it, mixed it with other ingredients,

00:50:23.390 --> 00:50:24.889
and made some dumplings.

00:50:24.890 --> 00:50:26.929
Soo Bin loves dumplings, you know.

00:50:26.930 --> 00:50:28.759
Hurry up and drop it
off before it gets cold.

00:50:28.899 --> 00:50:32.398
Grandma, can't you see
how serious the situation is?

00:50:32.399 --> 00:50:34.468
How could you make me
deliver dumplings in this situation?

00:50:34.469 --> 00:50:36.969
What is "this situation?"

00:50:37.140 --> 00:50:38.668
Are you now going to quit your studies...

00:50:38.669 --> 00:50:40.710
and goof around all day like a clown?

00:50:41.109 --> 00:50:43.910
Forget it. I'll ask Bal
San when he gets home.

00:50:44.109 --> 00:50:46.778
You never help me out.

00:50:46.779 --> 00:50:48.919
Goodness. Dear me.

00:50:50.180 --> 00:50:51.219
Gosh.

00:50:51.790 --> 00:50:54.160
Hey, who's Soo Bin?

00:50:54.960 --> 00:50:55.988
Is Soo Bin a girl?

00:50:55.989 --> 00:50:58.259
No, he's my grandma's
friend from her hometown.

00:50:58.930 --> 00:51:02.129
She's been taking care of him
ever since he moved to Seoul.

00:51:02.699 --> 00:51:04.430
Now, he works at our
school as a security guard.

00:51:11.210 --> 00:51:12.569
- Grandma!
- Ms. Go!

00:51:36.399 --> 00:51:38.029
You ran here? Are you that excited?

00:51:38.299 --> 00:51:39.299
You're wearing makeup.

00:51:40.129 --> 00:51:41.140
I guess you're excited.

00:51:41.839 --> 00:51:44.469
Look at you cracking jokes with
me. I guess everything went well.

00:51:46.339 --> 00:51:47.379
Yes, thanks to you.

00:51:48.109 --> 00:51:50.750
Thank you. I'll never forget
how you helped me out.

00:51:53.850 --> 00:51:55.619
Hey, were you drying fish
on the island or something?

00:51:55.620 --> 00:51:57.278
Oh, no. Do I stink?

00:51:57.279 --> 00:51:59.549
- Let me get changed quickly.
- No, don't bother.

00:51:59.790 --> 00:52:01.120
Let's just go. I'll buy you some.

00:52:01.690 --> 00:52:03.918
Buy me what? Clothes?

00:52:03.919 --> 00:52:04.959
Yes.

00:52:04.960 --> 00:52:06.790
Look at you, rich heiress.

00:52:06.989 --> 00:52:08.698
I made a lot of money
by selling US dollars.

00:52:08.699 --> 00:52:10.100
I can't turn them into
pasteboards, you know.

00:52:10.330 --> 00:52:11.870
Come on. You didn't have to say that.

00:52:12.730 --> 00:52:14.239
You sounded like one of
those rich heirs in dramas...

00:52:15.339 --> 00:52:18.039
and made me feel like a poor female
lead. It made my heart skip a beat.

00:52:18.040 --> 00:52:20.370
Gosh. Do you watch those lame dramas?

00:52:21.279 --> 00:52:23.008
Hey, the movie will start soon.

00:52:23.009 --> 00:52:24.049
We should hurry.

00:52:24.910 --> 00:52:25.910
Wait.

00:52:27.750 --> 00:52:29.949
You told me to always stay at
least two meters away from you.

00:52:33.049 --> 00:52:35.120
We don't have time. I'll
lift it for the time being.

00:52:38.089 --> 00:52:40.060
We're tight for time,
and I'm faster than you.

Anniversary, Sparkling Festival)

00:53:33.350 --> 00:53:34.419
Oh, my.

00:53:46.060 --> 00:53:47.500
Thank you, Ms. Go.

00:53:48.029 --> 00:53:49.330
Thanks to your dumplings,

00:53:49.629 --> 00:53:52.029
we can have a private rehearsal.

Hey, Kang Hoon.

00:54:06.149 --> 00:54:08.620
I'm on parole now, so I have
to be on my best behaviour.

00:54:09.279 --> 00:54:12.489
I have to lie low for the time being.

00:54:13.049 --> 00:54:15.219
That's why I needed your help,

00:54:15.390 --> 00:54:16.919
but you let me down like this.

00:54:17.629 --> 00:54:19.589
If you were me, would you be angry or not?

00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:22.029
Answer me!

00:54:23.460 --> 00:54:24.830
Why this little...

00:54:31.210 --> 00:54:34.009
I swear, I did exactly as you said.

00:54:35.140 --> 00:54:37.479
Then what? You told them
it was dangerous, didn't you?

00:54:37.480 --> 00:54:38.549
No.

00:54:38.779 --> 00:54:40.108
I swear,

00:54:40.109 --> 00:54:43.020
I did exactly as you said and
removed all the screws on the stage.

00:54:44.049 --> 00:54:45.190
Did you tell them to cancel it?

00:54:45.690 --> 00:54:46.919
No, I did not.

00:54:47.020 --> 00:54:49.719
They just went ahead and
cancelled the rehearsal.

00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:56.129
Didn't I tell you?

00:54:58.029 --> 00:54:59.930
I hate backstabbers.

00:55:00.969 --> 00:55:04.410
I don't care who it is.
I never forgive those...

00:55:04.969 --> 00:55:06.270
who stab me in the back.

00:55:07.540 --> 00:55:08.609
Do Jin!

00:55:14.680 --> 00:55:17.279
Hey, those punks are
rehearsing their performance now.

00:55:18.120 --> 00:55:20.889
They were headed to school at
this late hour, so we followed them.

00:55:20.890 --> 00:55:23.020
I think they bribed the
security guard to get the key.

00:55:23.359 --> 00:55:24.390
What should we do?

00:55:24.660 --> 00:55:26.629
Strike them? Shall we go for it, Do Jin?

00:55:27.230 --> 00:55:28.259
I should thank them...

00:55:28.830 --> 00:55:31.068
for crawling back into the
rabbit hole when no one's around.

00:55:31.069 --> 00:55:32.069
Exactly.

00:55:39.440 --> 00:55:41.140
You and your lame taste, heiress.

00:55:41.410 --> 00:55:43.779
Come on. Why? It reminds me
of "Squid Game." It looks nice.

00:55:44.350 --> 00:55:45.350
Here.

00:55:47.509 --> 00:55:48.549
"Squid Game?"

00:55:49.080 --> 00:55:52.249
The show didn't even exist in 1995.

00:55:52.250 --> 00:55:54.619
Oh, do you want to
go to the restroom first?

00:55:54.620 --> 00:55:56.520
I should probably go
before the movie starts.

00:55:56.719 --> 00:55:57.759
I'll go now, then.

00:55:59.790 --> 00:56:01.330
Was it some kind of joke back in 1995?

00:56:11.140 --> 00:56:12.468
First message.

00:56:12.469 --> 00:56:15.440
Hey, Eun Gyeol. We're going
to rehearse at the gym now.

00:56:15.540 --> 00:56:18.049
Come to the gym as soon
as you can when you hear this.

00:56:21.879 --> 00:56:22.949
What?

00:56:23.120 --> 00:56:25.250
Hey, the movie is about to
start. Where are you going?

00:56:25.649 --> 00:56:26.949
Hey, Eun Gyeol!

00:56:27.049 --> 00:56:30.120
But the truth is that I love you

00:56:30.560 --> 00:56:33.560
You are my world

00:56:34.129 --> 00:56:36.999
I'm screaming that to the world

00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:43.899
But the setting sun burns silently

00:56:54.680 --> 00:56:55.750
I can't believe this.

00:56:56.250 --> 00:56:58.149
So, Yoon Dong Jin
wasn't the helper, after all?

00:56:58.390 --> 00:57:01.059
Or is this happening because
you simply can't escape...

00:57:01.060 --> 00:57:02.190
what is fated to happen?

00:57:02.790 --> 00:57:03.959
It doesn't matter.

00:57:03.960 --> 00:57:06.359
I'll prevent the accident.
I'll prevent it at all costs.

(Baekwang High School's Sparkling Festival)

00:57:17.469 --> 00:57:18.469
Oh.

00:57:20.210 --> 00:57:21.639
It's been a while, Hyun Yul.

00:57:21.640 --> 00:57:23.039
We're here, Hyun Yul!

00:57:23.040 --> 00:57:25.210
This is going to be fun!

00:57:27.549 --> 00:57:28.549
Shut it.

00:57:31.290 --> 00:57:34.660
Hey, Hyun Yul. Do you know these guys?

00:57:37.160 --> 00:57:39.129
(Baekwang High School's Sparkling Festival)

00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:45.069
Oh, right.

00:57:48.299 --> 00:57:49.839
I brought you a gift.

00:57:51.810 --> 00:57:52.810
Come on, Hoon.

00:57:54.739 --> 00:57:56.339
Ta-Da.

00:57:59.210 --> 00:58:02.680
I heard he tried to ruin your
performance earlier in the day.

00:58:03.779 --> 00:58:06.989
Hey, why did you do something
you were never told to do?

00:58:14.699 --> 00:58:16.129
How do you feel to be stabbed in the back?

00:58:17.330 --> 00:58:18.398
Do Jin.

00:58:18.399 --> 00:58:20.569
I'll now show you the consequences...

00:58:21.370 --> 00:58:22.770
of stabbing me in the back.

00:58:24.739 --> 00:58:25.969
If you want to take me down, go for it,

00:58:26.270 --> 00:58:27.509
but let my friends go.

00:58:28.480 --> 00:58:29.779
They have nothing to do with this.

00:58:33.049 --> 00:58:36.879
The hibiscus flower has bloomed

00:58:38.890 --> 00:58:42.089
It's looking glamorous in full bloom

00:58:45.160 --> 00:58:46.730
I want to trample on
the soil and nothing else,

00:58:47.560 --> 00:58:49.330
but these petals keep fluttering down.

00:58:50.600 --> 00:58:51.930
So what should I do?

00:58:52.169 --> 00:58:53.299
I have no choice...

00:58:53.969 --> 00:58:56.199
but to trample on them all. You know?

00:58:58.770 --> 00:58:59.770
Whack them.

00:59:04.109 --> 00:59:06.379
We meet again. Don't mess with me!

00:59:08.080 --> 00:59:09.080
Darn you!

00:59:09.081 --> 00:59:10.520
Get them!

00:59:12.020 --> 00:59:13.020
- Hey!
- Get him!

00:59:14.989 --> 00:59:16.120
Hey!

00:59:18.890 --> 00:59:21.330
- You!
- Darn it!

00:59:25.699 --> 00:59:26.969
Hey, let go!

00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:32.109
You rats!

00:59:33.839 --> 00:59:34.879
Let go.

00:59:40.009 --> 00:59:42.080
- Hey!
- Whack them!

00:59:42.919 --> 00:59:44.549
- Are you all right?
- Of course.

00:59:46.520 --> 00:59:47.520
You little...

00:59:55.230 --> 00:59:57.600
Hey!

00:59:58.799 --> 01:00:00.999
Hey, young man.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:02.940
Hey! Are you all right?

01:00:04.469 --> 01:00:05.469
- My gosh.
- Are you okay?

01:00:11.449 --> 01:00:12.580
Oh, no!

(Baekwang High School's Sparkling Festival)

01:00:26.790 --> 01:00:27.830
Darn you!

01:00:34.469 --> 01:00:37.069
Hey, get up. Get lost.

01:00:39.569 --> 01:00:40.640
Get down!

01:01:01.029 --> 01:01:03.160
You'll get into an accident
at the rehearsal today.

01:01:03.899 --> 01:01:05.000
That accident...

01:01:05.730 --> 01:01:07.299
will change your life.

01:01:08.739 --> 01:01:09.739
Was he talking about this?

01:01:10.239 --> 01:01:11.940
I know your future,

01:01:12.410 --> 01:01:14.680
and I found out how to change your life.

01:01:16.810 --> 01:01:17.839
So, that...

01:01:19.310 --> 01:01:20.350
was true?

01:01:20.580 --> 01:01:22.250
Darn, I'm supposed to be lying low now.

01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:24.520
You guys made me take
matters into my own hands.

01:01:26.419 --> 01:01:27.819
Hey!

01:01:34.330 --> 01:01:37.359
Don't hurt Yi Chan, you jerks!

01:01:47.210 --> 01:01:50.279
Don't hurt Yi Chan, you scumbag!

01:01:53.310 --> 01:01:55.219
There are cops outside!

01:01:57.080 --> 01:01:58.089
Let's go!

01:02:04.660 --> 01:02:05.660
Yi Chan.

01:02:06.859 --> 01:02:08.830
Wake up. Please?

01:02:09.259 --> 01:02:11.370
Open your eyes, okay?

01:02:12.169 --> 01:02:13.199
Hey, can you hear me?

01:02:14.169 --> 01:02:16.339
Answer me. Can you hear me?

01:02:18.540 --> 01:02:21.009
You're so loud. Quiet down, will you?

01:02:22.009 --> 01:02:23.379
You can hear my voice?

01:02:25.980 --> 01:02:27.009
Yes, I can hear it.

01:02:28.020 --> 01:02:29.020
Loud and clear.

01:02:42.029 --> 01:02:43.060
I did it.

There's something you don't know.

01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:26.668
There's nothing I hate
more than being abandoned.

01:03:26.669 --> 01:03:28.409
I won't go easy on you today.

01:03:28.410 --> 01:03:30.209
Hey, I have one too.

01:03:30.210 --> 01:03:32.548
I said I'd tell you my secret
when the time was right.

01:03:32.549 --> 01:03:33.608
I'll tell you all about it now.

01:03:33.609 --> 01:03:34.749
Choose me.

01:03:34.750 --> 01:03:35.778
That's love.

01:03:35.779 --> 01:03:38.390
You'll end up writing
great lyrics for a song.

01:03:38.520 --> 01:03:40.718
No, the festival is over.

01:03:40.719 --> 01:03:42.159
Don't visit me again.

01:03:42.160 --> 01:03:43.889
Can you please leave me alone?

01:03:43.890 --> 01:03:45.758
You and I will never have
to see each other again.

01:03:45.759 --> 01:03:48.798
You and I live in different worlds, anyway.

01:03:48.799 --> 01:03:50.759
It was great knowing you, Yi Chan.
